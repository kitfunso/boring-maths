## 2. Sample Reddit Posts

### Post Template 1: FIRE Calculator (r/financialindependence)

**Title:** I built a free FIRE calculator with Lean/Fat/Coast projections

**Body:**
```
Hey everyone,

I've been on my FIRE journey for a few years and always found existing calculators lacking - they didn't show the different FIRE variations or account for Coast FIRE properly.

So I built one: [link to fire-calculator]

Features:
- Lean FIRE / Regular FIRE / Fat FIRE projections
- Coast FIRE calculation (when you can stop contributing)
- Adjustable withdrawal rate and inflation
- Visual timeline to FI

It's completely free, no signup required, and all calculations happen in your browser (privacy-focused).

Would love feedback from this community - what features would make it more useful for you?
```

### Post Template 2: Paint Calculator (r/HomeImprovement)

**Title:** Made a paint calculator that actually accounts for doors/windows

**Body:**
```
Got tired of overbuying or underbuying paint, so I built a calculator that:

- Subtracts doors and windows from wall area
- Accounts for different coverage rates per paint type
- Calculates for multiple coats
- Shows gallons needed (rounds up appropriately)

Free to use: [link]

Saved me from a third trip to Home Depot last weekend. Hope it helps someone else!
```

### Post Template 3: UK Tax Trap (r/UKPersonalFinance)

**Title:** Calculator to escape the £100k-£125k tax trap

**Body:**
```
If you're earning between £100k-£125k, you're probably aware of the brutal 60% marginal tax rate from losing your Personal Allowance.

I made a calculator that shows:
- Exactly how much you lose to the trap
- Optimal pension contributions to restore your PA
- Net benefit of salary sacrifice

Link: [uk-100k-tax-trap-calculator]

Found it useful for my own tax planning - hopefully helps others in the same situation.
```
