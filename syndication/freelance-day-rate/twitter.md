# Twitter/X Thread: Freelance Day Rate

## Thread

1/ Most freelancers are undercharging by 30-50%.

Not because they lack confidence.

Because they're doing the math wrong.

Here's the calculation that changed how I price my work:

---

2/ The rookie mistake:

"My salary was $75k, so my day rate is $288"

($75,000 ÷ 260 working days)

This logic seems sound. It's also leaving thousands on the table.

---

3/ Problem #1: You don't have 260 billable days.

Take 260 weekdays. Subtract:
→ Vacation: 15-20 days
→ Holidays: 10-12 days
→ Sick time: 5-10 days
→ Admin/marketing: 20-30 days
→ Gaps between projects: 10-20 days

Reality: 200-230 billable days.

---

4/ Problem #2: Self-employment tax.

As an employee, your company pays half your Social Security/Medicare.

As a freelancer? You pay the full 15.3%.

That's before federal and state income tax.

Budget 25-40% of your gross for taxes.

---

5/ Problem #3: Benefits aren't free.

When you freelance, YOU pay for:
→ Health insurance ($5k-$20k/year)
→ Retirement contributions
→ Equipment and software
→ Professional development
→ Liability insurance

Add 20-40% to cover what your employer used to.

---

6/ The real formula:

Target salary
+ Benefits you'll self-fund
+ Tax adjustment for SE tax
÷ Realistic billable days (220)
= Your actual minimum day rate

---

7/ Running the numbers:

$75k target salary
+ $15k in benefits
= $90k base need
+ 30% for taxes
= $117k gross needed
÷ 220 billable days
= **$531/day minimum**

Not $288. Almost double.

---

8/ This is why the "1.5-2x rule" exists.

Your freelance day rate should be 1.5-2x what an equivalent employee earns daily.

It's not about charging more.

It's about earning the same.

---

9/ I built a free calculator that does all this math:

→ boring-math.com/calculators/freelance-day-rate-calculator

Plug in your numbers. See what you should actually be charging.

No signup. Just math.

---

10/ The bottom line:

If you priced yourself like an employee, you're working more hours for less money.

Run. Your. Numbers.

Your future self will thank you.
