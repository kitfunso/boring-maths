So I've been freelancing for a while now and it took me embarrassingly long to figure out why my rates felt low even though I "matched" my old salary.

The problem was how I calculated it.

**What I did:** $75k salary ÷ 260 working days = $288/day

**What I should have done:**

1. **Account for actual billable days** - I don't bill 260 days. Between vacation, holidays, sick days, admin time, and gaps between clients, I realistically bill 220 days. Some years less.

2. **Add self-employment tax** - As an employee, my company paid half my Social Security/Medicare. Now I pay all 15.3%. On top of income tax, I need to set aside 30-35% for taxes.

3. **Replace my benefits** - Health insurance alone is $8k/year for me. Add retirement contributions, equipment, software... call it $15k total that my employer used to cover.

Running the real math:
- $75k target + $15k benefits = $90k
- Need ~$117k gross to net $90k after 30% taxes
- $117k ÷ 220 billable days = $531/day

That's almost double my original "matching" rate.

This is why experienced freelancers say to charge 1.5-2x employee equivalent. It's not about charging a premium—it's about breaking even.

**TL;DR:** If you divided your old salary by 260 to get your day rate, you're probably undercharging by 30-50%.

- "The hidden costs of self-employment that I wish someone had explained with actual numbers"

### Post

I see a lot of posts here from people considering freelancing or consulting, and one thing that often gets glossed over is the math of self-employment pricing.

A common approach: "I make $X salary, so I'll charge $X ÷ 260 days as my freelance rate."

This leaves a LOT of money on the table. Here's why:

**The costs you inherit:**

1. **Self-employment tax: 15.3%**
   - As an employee, your employer pays half of Social Security and Medicare
   - As self-employed, you pay the full 15.3%
   - This is on TOP of regular income tax

2. **Benefits replacement:**
   - Health insurance: $5,000-20,000/year depending on your situation
   - Retirement: No employer match anymore
   - Equipment, software, professional development: All on you
   - Estimate 20-40% of your target income for benefits

3. **Lost billable time:**
   - You won't bill 260 days/year
   - Subtract vacation, holidays, sick time: ~30 days
   - Subtract admin, marketing, invoicing: ~25 days  
   - Subtract gaps between clients: ~15 days
   - Realistic billable days: 190-230

**Doing the math:**

Let's say you want to match a $75k salary with full benefits.

- $75k + $15k benefits replacement = $90k net target
- At 30% effective tax rate (including SE tax), you need ~$129k gross
- At 220 billable days, that's $586/day
- The "naive" calculation ($75k ÷ 260) = $288/day

You'd be earning about **half** of what you need.

**The 1.5-2x rule:**

This is why financial advisors and experienced freelancers recommend charging 1.5-2x your equivalent employee daily rate. It's not greed—it's math.

If you're considering self-employment, run these numbers for your specific situation before making the leap.
