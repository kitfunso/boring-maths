# I Built a Day Rate Calculator Because I Was Charging Too Little as a Freelancer

When I started freelancing, I did what most people do: took my old salary, divided by 260 working days, and called it a day rate.

I was leaving *a lot* of money on the table.

## The Math Most Freelancers Get Wrong

Here's the problem with the "salary ÷ 260" approach:

**1. You don't actually have 260 billable days.**

Start with 260 weekdays. Now subtract:
- 15-20 vacation days
- 10-12 holidays  
- 5-10 sick days
- 20-30 days of admin, marketing, invoicing
- 10-20 days of gaps between projects

You're looking at 200-230 billable days, realistically. Most freelancers settle around 220.

**2. Self-employment tax is brutal.**

In the US, freelancers pay 15.3% self-employment tax (Social Security + Medicare) *on top of* regular income tax. As an employee, your employer covers half of this. As a freelancer, you pay all of it.

Combined with federal and state income tax, most freelancers should budget **25-40%** of gross income for taxes.

**3. Benefits aren't free.**

That health insurance your employer was paying for? That's $5,000-$20,000/year you now need to cover. 401(k) matching? Gone. Equipment, software, professional development? Your problem now.

## The Real Formula

Here's what your day rate calculation should actually look like:

```
Target Annual Income (what you'd earn as employee)
+ Benefits you need to self-fund (~$10,000-25,000)
+ Tax adjustment (~30% more to cover SE tax)
÷ Realistic billable days (~220)
= Minimum Day Rate
```

A $75,000 salary doesn't translate to a $288/day rate ($75k ÷ 260).

It translates to roughly **$400-450/day** once you account for reality.

## The 1.5-2x Rule

This is why experienced freelancers often quote the "1.5-2x rule": your day rate should be 1.5-2x what an equivalent employee makes daily.

It's not greed. It's math.

## I Built a Tool

I got tired of doing this calculation manually every time rates came up, so I built a calculator that handles all of this:

→ [Freelance Day Rate Calculator](https://boring-math.com/calculators/freelance-day-rate-calculator)

You input your target salary, tax rate, time off, and benefits value. It spits out your minimum day rate, hourly equivalent, and annual projections.

No signup. No email capture. Just math.

## The Takeaway

If you're freelancing and haven't done this math properly, you might be working more hours for less effective pay than your employed peers.

Run your numbers. You might be surprised.
