# LinkedIn Post: Freelance Day Rate Calculator

## Post

When I transitioned from employee to consultant, I made a costly mistake.

I calculated my day rate like this: Annual salary ÷ 260 working days = Day rate.

Simple. Logical. And wrong.

**Here's what that formula misses:**

**1. Billable days ≠ working days**

Between business development, admin, gaps between engagements, and actual time off, most independent consultants bill 200-230 days annually. Not 260.

**2. Tax burden shifts dramatically**

Self-employment tax adds 15.3% that employers previously covered. Combined with income taxes, independents should budget 25-40% for taxes—significantly more than payroll deductions.

**3. Benefits require funding**

Health insurance, retirement contributions, professional development, equipment—these costs don't disappear. They transfer to you.

**The 1.5-2x benchmark exists for a reason.**

Experienced consultants often charge 1.5-2x the equivalent employee daily rate. This isn't premium pricing. It's equivalent compensation.

A $100K salary translates to roughly $550-650/day as an independent—not the $385 that simple division suggests.

**For anyone considering the transition, or renegotiating current rates:**

I built a calculator that accounts for all these factors—tax adjustments, benefits, realistic billable days:
