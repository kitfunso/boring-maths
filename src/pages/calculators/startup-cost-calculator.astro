// FAQ data

  {
    question: 'How much does it cost to start a small business?',
    answer:
      'Startup costs vary widely by business type. A consulting business might start with $5,000-$10,000, while a restaurant could require $100,000-$500,000. E-commerce businesses typically fall in between at $10,000-$50,000. Use this calculator with your specific business type for accurate estimates.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is runway and why does it matter?',
    answer:
      'Runway is how long your business can operate before running out of money. Most experts recommend 12-18 months of runway. This gives you time to become profitable or raise additional funding without running out of cash.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I include a contingency buffer?',
    answer:
      'Yes, always include a 15-25% contingency buffer. Unexpected costs always arise - equipment breaks, permits cost more than expected, or revenue takes longer to materialize. A contingency buffer prevents these surprises from sinking your business.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What are one-time vs monthly costs?',
    answer:
      'One-time costs are paid once at startup (equipment, legal fees, deposits, renovations). Monthly costs recur each month (rent, utilities, salaries, marketing). Your total capital needs include both one-time costs plus monthly costs multiplied by your runway months.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much should I pay myself as a founder?',
    answer:
      'Pay yourself enough to cover living expenses without stress. Many founders take below-market salaries initially, but taking nothing leads to burnout. A common approach is covering your basic needs (housing, food, insurance) while reinvesting the rest.',

    <p>
      Select your <strong>business type</strong> to load industry-typical cost estimates. The calculator
      includes presets for consulting, e-commerce, SaaS, service businesses, retail, and restaurants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adjust the <strong>number of employees</strong> and <strong>runway months</strong> based on your
      plans. More employees and longer runway significantly increase capital requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Set your <strong>founder salary</strong> to cover your living expenses during the startup phase.
      Don't forget to include a contingency buffer for unexpected costs.

  <!-- Understanding Results Section -->
  <ContentSection title="Understanding Your Results">
    <p>
      <strong>One-time costs</strong> are expenses you pay once at launch - equipment, legal setup, initial
      inventory, security deposits, and renovations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Monthly burn rate</strong> is your ongoing monthly expenses including rent, utilities, software,
      marketing, and salaries. This determines how quickly you consume your capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Total capital needed</strong> combines one-time costs plus monthly burn multiplied by runway
      months, plus your contingency buffer. This is the minimum you need to start.
