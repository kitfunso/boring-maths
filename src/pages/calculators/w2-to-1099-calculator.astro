  {
    question: 'What is the typical W2 to 1099 rate multiplier?',
    answer:
      'Most experts recommend multiplying your W2 hourly rate by 1.25x to 1.5x to get your equivalent 1099 rate. The exact multiplier depends on your benefits package, health insurance costs, and business expenses. Higher-benefit W2 jobs require higher multipliers.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is self-employment tax?',
    answer:
      'Self-employment tax is 15.3% (12.4% Social Security + 2.9% Medicare) on 92.35% of your net self-employment income. As a W2 employee, your employer pays half of this (7.65%). As a 1099 contractor, you pay the full amount yourself, making it one of the biggest hidden costs of contracting.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I account for lost health insurance?',
    answer:
      "Typical employer health insurance costs $500-800/month per employee. As a contractor, you'll pay this entirely yourself through marketplace insurance, COBRA, or a spouse's plan. Add this annual cost to your rate calculation - it's often $6,000-10,000/year.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I factor in PTO?',
    answer:
      "Yes! W2 employees typically get 15-25 days of paid time off plus holidays. As a 1099 contractor, you don't get paid when you're not working. This means your annual billable hours are lower, so your hourly rate needs to be higher to achieve the same annual income.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What about 401k employer match?',
    answer:
      "Many employers match 3-6% of your salary in 401k contributions. This is free money you lose as a contractor. While you can open a SEP-IRA or Solo 401k, there's no employer match. Factor this into your rate calculation.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What business expenses should I consider?',
    answer:
      'Common contractor expenses include: accounting/taxes ($1,000-3,000/year), liability insurance ($500-2,000/year), software and tools ($100-500/month), home office costs, and professional development. Budget $200-500/month for these costs.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What are billable hours?',
    answer:
      "Billable hours are the hours you can actually charge clients for. As a contractor, you'll spend time on admin, marketing, invoicing, and other unbillable work. Most contractors can bill 75-85% of their working hours. A 40-hour week might only yield 32-34 billable hours.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Is it worth going 1099?',
    answer:
      'It depends on your situation. Contractors often earn 20-50% more gross income but must cover their own benefits and taxes. The flexibility and potential for higher earnings can be valuable, but you lose job security and benefits. Use this calculator to determine your minimum rate before deciding.',

        The calculator shows your <strong class="text-green-400">equivalent 1099 rate</strong> - the hourly

        The <strong class="text-[var(--color-cream)]">multiplier</strong> shows how many times your W2
        rate you need to charge. A multiplier of 1.4x means if you make $50/hour as W2, you need $70/hour
        as 1099.

        <strong class="text-green-400">Rule of thumb:</strong> Only consider 1099 work if the rate is

  <ContentSection title="Key Factors in Your W2 to 1099 Conversion">
    <div class="space-y-4 text-[var(--color-subtle)]">
      <p>
        Converting from W2 employment to 1099 contracting involves several hidden costs that many
        people overlook. Understanding these factors is critical to setting a rate that actually
        maintains your standard of living.
      </p>

      <h4 class="font-semibold text-[var(--color-cream)]">Self-Employment Tax (15.3%)</h4>
      <p>
        As a W2 employee, your employer pays half of your Social Security and Medicare taxes
        (7.65%). As a 1099 contractor, you pay the full 15.3% yourself — broken down as 12.4% for
        Social Security (on income up to $176,100 in 2025) and 2.9% for Medicare on all earnings.
        You can deduct half of your self-employment tax from your adjusted gross income, but this is
        still a significant cost that reduces your take-home pay by thousands of dollars each year.
      </p>

      <h4 class="font-semibold text-[var(--color-cream)]">Health Insurance Costs</h4>
      <p>
        The average annual premium for employer-sponsored health insurance is $7,911 for single
        coverage and over $22,000 for family coverage (2023 KFF survey). Employers typically cover
        80-83% of this cost. As a contractor, you bear the full premium yourself through marketplace
        plans, COBRA, or a professional association plan. While self-employed health insurance
        premiums are tax-deductible, the out-of-pocket cost is substantial and must be factored into
        your rate.
      </p>

      <h4 class="font-semibold text-[var(--color-cream)]">Retirement Contribution Differences</h4>
      <p>
        Many employers offer 401(k) matching contributions of 3-6% of salary — effectively free
        money that disappears when you go independent. As a contractor, you can open a Solo 401(k)
        or SEP-IRA with high contribution limits ($69,000 combined in 2024), but there is no
        employer match. If your current employer matches 4% on a $100,000 salary, that is $4,000 per
        year in lost compensation your contractor rate needs to replace.
      </p>

      <h4 class="font-semibold text-[var(--color-cream)]">Utilization Rate and Billable Hours</h4>
      <p>
        Full-time employees are paid for 2,080 hours per year (40 hours x 52 weeks). Contractors
        must account for non-billable time spent on marketing, invoicing, administrative tasks,
        professional development, and finding new clients. Most independent consultants achieve a
        utilization rate of 65-80%, meaning only 1,350 to 1,660 hours per year are actually
        billable. Factor in 2-4 weeks of unpaid vacation and sick time, and your effective billable
        hours drop further. This is why a $50/hour W2 rate typically requires $70-80/hour as a
        contractor just to break even.
