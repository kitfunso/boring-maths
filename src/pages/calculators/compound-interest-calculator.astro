  {
    question: "What is compound interest?",
    answer: "Compound interest is interest calculated on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. It's essentially 'interest on interest' and causes wealth to grow exponentially over time."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the compound interest formula?",
    answer: "The formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the final amount, P is principal, r is annual interest rate, n is compounds per year, and t is time in years. With regular contributions, the formula becomes more complex."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the Rule of 72?",
    answer: "The Rule of 72 is a quick way to estimate how long it takes to double your money. Divide 72 by your interest rate percentage. At 8% annual return, money doubles in approximately 9 years (72/8=9)."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should interest compound?",
    answer: "More frequent compounding produces higher returns. Daily compounding beats monthly, which beats annually. However, the difference is usually small for typical savings rates. Focus on getting the best rate rather than compound frequency."

  <ContentSection title="How to Use This Calculator">
    <p>
      Enter your <strong>initial investment</strong> - the lump sum you're starting with.
      This could be savings, an inheritance, or any amount you want to invest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specify <strong>monthly contributions</strong> to see how regular investing
      accelerates your growth. Even small amounts add up significantly over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Set the <strong>interest rate</strong> based on your expected returns.
      The S&P 500 has historically returned about 10% annually, but past performance
      doesn't guarantee future results.
    </p>
    <p>
      Choose your <strong>compound frequency</strong> - how often interest is calculated
      and added to your principal. Monthly is typical for most investments.
    </p>
  </ContentSection>

  <ContentSection title="Understanding Your Results">
    <p>
      <strong>Future value</strong> shows what your investment will be worth at the
      end of your investment period. This includes all contributions and earned interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Total interest</strong> is the money you earned from compounding alone.
      This is essentially "free money" generated by your investment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>growth chart</strong> shows how contributions (your money) and
      interest (earned money) grow over time. Notice how interest becomes a larger
      portion in later years - that's compound interest at work.
