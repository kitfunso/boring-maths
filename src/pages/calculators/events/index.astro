  <p>
    Our event planning calculators take the guesswork out of party planning. Whether you're
    hosting a wedding, throwing a BBQ, or organizing a birthday party, these tools help you
    buy the right amount of food and drinks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Running out of supplies mid-party is stressful. Over-buying wastes money. Our calculators
    use industry-standard formulas adjusted for event duration, guest demographics, and
    serving styles to give you accurate estimates.

  <h3>Event Planning Guidelines</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Alcohol Rule of Thumb:</strong> Plan for 1-2 drinks per person for the first hour, then 1 drink per hour after</li>
    <li><strong>BBQ Portions:</strong> 1/3 to 1/2 pound of raw meat per adult, less for events with many sides</li>
    <li><strong>Drinks per Person:</strong> 2-3 non-alcoholic drinks per person for a 3-4 hour event</li>
    <li><strong>Ice Calculation:</strong> 1.5 pounds of ice per person, more in hot weather</li>
  </ul>
