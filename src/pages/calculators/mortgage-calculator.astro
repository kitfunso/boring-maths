  {
    question: 'How is monthly mortgage payment calculated?',
    answer:
      'Monthly mortgage payment is calculated using the amortization formula: M = P[r(1+r)^n]/[(1+r)^n-1], where P is the loan amount, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of payments. This gives you the principal and interest portion. Add property tax, insurance, and HOA for your total monthly payment.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much down payment do I need for a house?',
    answer:
      'While 20% down payment is traditional to avoid PMI, you can put down as little as 3-5% for conventional loans or 0% for VA loans. A larger down payment means lower monthly payments and less interest paid over time.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is PMI and when is it required?',
    answer:
      'Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) is required when your down payment is less than 20% of the home price. PMI typically costs 0.5-1% of the loan amount annually and can be removed once you reach 20% equity.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I choose a 15-year or 30-year mortgage?',
    answer:
      'A 15-year mortgage has higher monthly payments but saves significantly on interest. A 30-year mortgage has lower payments but costs more over time. Choose based on your monthly budget and long-term financial goals.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much house can I afford on my salary?',
    answer:
      "A common guideline is the 28/36 rule: spend no more than 28% of gross monthly income on housing costs, and no more than 36% on total debt. On a $75,000 salary, that's about $1,750/month for housing, which supports roughly a $300,000-$350,000 home depending on rates and down payment.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What credit score do I need to buy a house?',
    answer:
      'Minimum credit scores vary by loan type: FHA loans require 580+ (or 500 with 10% down), conventional loans typically need 620+, and the best rates go to borrowers with 740+. Higher scores mean lower interest rates and significant savings over the life of the loan.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What are closing costs and how much should I expect?',
    answer:
      'Closing costs are fees paid when finalizing your mortgage, typically 2-5% of the loan amount. They include appraisal fees, title insurance, attorney fees, and prepaid items like property taxes and insurance. On a $300,000 loan, expect $6,000-$15,000 in closing costs.',

  <ContentSection title="How to Use This Calculator">
    <p>
      Enter the <strong>home price</strong> - the total purchase price of the property you're considering.
      This is the amount before any down payment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specify your <strong>down payment</strong> amount. The calculator will show the percentage automatically.
      A 20% down payment avoids PMI requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adjust the <strong>interest rate</strong> to match current market rates or the rate your lender
      has quoted you. Even small rate differences significantly impact total cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Include optional costs like <strong>property tax</strong>, <strong>insurance</strong>, and <strong
        >HOA fees</strong
      > to see your true monthly housing cost.
    </p>
  </ContentSection>

  <ContentSection title="Understanding Your Results">
    <p>
      <strong>Monthly payment</strong> shows your total housing cost including principal, interest, taxes,
      insurance, and HOA fees. This is what you'll actually pay each month.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Total interest</strong> is the total amount you'll pay in interest over the life of the
      loan. A shorter term or lower rate reduces this significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Loan-to-value (LTV)</strong> ratio shows what percentage of the home value you're borrowing.
      Lower LTV means more equity and potentially better rates.
    </p>
  </ContentSection>

  <ContentSection title="15-Year vs 30-Year Mortgage">
    <p>
      A <strong>15-year mortgage</strong> typically offers interest rates 0.5-0.75% lower than 30-year
      loans. While monthly payments are higher, you'll pay significantly less interest over the life of
      the loan and build equity faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <strong>30-year mortgage</strong> has lower monthly payments, giving you more flexibility in your
      budget. This can be advantageous if you invest the difference or need cash flow for other goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Example:</strong> On a $300,000 loan at 7% interest, a 15-year mortgage costs $2,696/month
      with $185,000 total interest. A 30-year mortgage costs $1,996/month but $418,000 total interest
      - more than double.
    </p>
  </ContentSection>

  <ContentSection title="Tips for First-Time Home Buyers">
    <p>
      <strong>Get pre-approved first.</strong> A mortgage pre-approval shows sellers you're serious and
      tells you exactly how much house you can afford before you start shopping.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Don't forget closing costs.</strong> Budget 2-5% of the loan amount for closing costs on
      top of your down payment. On a $300,000 home, that's $6,000-$15,000 extra.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Consider all costs.</strong> Your mortgage payment isn't your only expense. Factor in property
      taxes, insurance, maintenance (1-2% of home value annually), and potential HOA fees.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Shop around for rates.</strong> Getting quotes from 3-5 lenders can save you thousands over
      the life of your loan. Even a 0.25% rate difference matters significantly.
