// FAQ data
const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'How do I compare job offers with different benefits?',
    answer:
      'Convert all benefits to annual monetary value. Include: base salary, bonus (expected value), equity (annual vesting value), 401k match (your contribution * match rate), health insurance (employer premium - your cost), PTO (daily rate * days), and other perks. Our calculator does this automatically.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I include commute costs when comparing offers?',
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Commute costs include gas, wear on your car (~$0.67/mile IRS rate), parking, and tolls. But also consider the time cost - an extra 30 minutes each way is 250+ hours per year. At your hourly rate, that's significant. Our calculator factors in both.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How much is a day of PTO actually worth?',
    answer:
      "Your PTO value equals your daily rate (annual salary / 260 working days). If you earn $75,000, each PTO day is worth about $288. An offer with 5 more PTO days is worth $1,440+ annually. Don't dismiss PTO differences as minor.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I value equity or RSUs in a job offer?',
    answer:
      'For public companies, use the current stock value of your annual vesting amount. For startups, be conservative - most equity becomes worthless. Consider using 10-25% of the stated value for early-stage startups. Our calculator lets you input your own estimate.',
  },
  {
    question: "What's the typical 401k match I should expect?",
    answer:
      'The most common 401k match is 50% of contributions up to 6% of salary (effectively 3% free money). Some companies offer 100% match up to 4-6%, or even higher. A 6% match on a $100,000 salary is $6,000/year - equivalent to a $6,000 raise.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I compare offers with different bonus structures?',
    answer:
      "Consider the expected value, not the maximum. If a 10% bonus is 'target' with 80% of employees hitting it, use 10%. If it's discretionary and rarely paid in full, discount it. Ask the recruiter what percentage of employees hit target bonus.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I take a higher salary or better benefits?',
    answer:
      'It depends on your situation. Pre-tax benefits (401k match, health insurance) are more tax-efficient than salary. But salary forms the base for future raises and often for future job offers. Our calculator shows the total value to help you decide.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much more should a new job pay to be worth switching?',
    answer:
      'A common rule is 10-20% more total compensation to offset the risk and disruption of changing jobs. However, consider non-monetary factors: career growth, learning opportunities, work-life balance, management quality, and job security.',

  <!-- How to Use Section -->
  <ContentSection title="How to Use This Calculator">
    <p>
      Enter the details for both job offers including <strong>base salary</strong>,
      <strong>bonus percentage</strong>, and any <strong>equity or RSUs</strong> (use the annual vesting
      value).
    </p>
    <p>
      Add the <strong>401k match details</strong> - both the match percentage and the limit they'll match
      up to. For example, "4% match up to 6%" means they'll match dollar-for-dollar on the first 4% of
      your contribution, up to 6% of your salary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Include <strong>health insurance costs</strong>. Enter your monthly premium contribution and
      the total annual value of the health plan (usually found on your benefits summary).
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't forget <strong>commute details</strong>. Enter the one-way distance and how many days
      per week you'll be in the office. The calculator factors in both the direct cost and time
      opportunity cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adjust the <strong>calculation settings</strong> at the bottom to set your hourly time value (what
      your time is worth to you) and driving cost per mile.
    </p>
  </ContentSection>

  <!-- Understanding Results Section -->
  <ContentSection title="Understanding Your Results">
    <p>
      The <strong>Net Total Compensation</strong> is the key number. It includes all monetary benefits
      minus your commute costs and (optionally) commute time value.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>component breakdown</strong> shows how each offer compares across different categories.
      The highlighted bars indicate which offer is better in each area.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>effective hourly rate</strong> divides your net compensation by total time spent (work
      hours plus commute). This reveals the true value of your time at each job.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>considerations section</strong> highlights significant differences between the offers
      that might influence your decision beyond pure compensation.
