    question: 'What is TDEE?',
    answer:
      'TDEE stands for Total Daily Energy Expenditure. It is the total number of calories your body burns in a day, including your basal metabolic rate (BMR), physical activity, and the thermic effect of food. Knowing your TDEE helps you set calorie targets for weight loss, maintenance, or muscle gain.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the Mifflin-St Jeor equation?',
    answer:
      'The Mifflin-St Jeor equation is considered the most accurate formula for estimating BMR. For men: BMR = 10 × weight(kg) + 6.25 × height(cm) - 5 × age + 5. For women: BMR = 10 × weight(kg) + 6.25 × height(cm) - 5 × age - 161. Your TDEE is then BMR multiplied by an activity factor.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I choose my activity level?',
    answer:
      'Be honest about your typical week. Sedentary means a desk job with no exercise. Lightly active is 1-3 light workouts per week. Moderately active is 3-5 moderate sessions. Very active is 6-7 hard sessions. Extra active includes athletes or people with physically demanding jobs who also train.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How many calories should I eat to lose weight?',
    answer:
      'A safe and sustainable deficit is 500 calories below your TDEE, which equates to roughly 1 pound (0.45 kg) of fat loss per week. Never go below 1,200 calories (women) or 1,500 calories (men) without medical supervision.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What are macro splits?',
    answer:
      'Macro splits divide your daily calories into protein, carbohydrates, and fat. A balanced split is 30/40/30. Low-carb diets use 40/20/40. High-carb (endurance athletes) use 25/55/20. Keto is 25/5/70. The best split depends on your goals and preferences.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How accurate is a TDEE calculator?',
    answer:
      'TDEE calculators provide a solid starting estimate, typically within 10% of your actual expenditure. Factors like genetics, hormones, NEAT (non-exercise activity thermogenesis), and muscle mass create individual variation. Use your TDEE as a starting point, then adjust based on real-world results over 2-3 weeks.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the difference between BMR and TDEE?',
    answer:
      'BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) is the calories your body burns at complete rest — just to keep you alive (breathing, circulation, cell repair). TDEE includes BMR plus calories burned through physical activity, exercise, and digesting food. TDEE is always higher than BMR.',

  <ContentSection title="How to Use This Calculator">
    <p>
      Enter your <strong>age, sex, height, and weight</strong> to calculate your Basal Metabolic Rate
      (BMR) using the Mifflin-St Jeor equation — the most accurate formula validated by research.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select your <strong>activity level</strong> honestly. This multiplier converts your resting BMR
      into your Total Daily Energy Expenditure. Most people overestimate their activity level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the <strong>goal calories</strong> to plan weight loss (-500 cal/day ≈ 1 lb/week loss) or lean
      muscle gain (+500 cal/day). The macro splits help you distribute calories across protein, carbs,
      and fat.
    </p>
  </ContentSection>

  <ContentSection title="Understanding TDEE and BMR">
    <p>
      Your <strong>BMR</strong> accounts for 60-75% of daily calorie burn. It powers breathing, circulation,
      brain function, and cellular repair — the energy you'd burn lying in bed all day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Physical activity</strong> adds 15-30% depending on how active you are. The thermic effect
      of food (digesting what you eat) accounts for roughly 10% of total expenditure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>NEAT</strong> (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis) — fidgeting, walking, standing — can
      vary by up to 2,000 calories between individuals and is often the biggest hidden variable.
    </p>
  </ContentSection>

  <ContentSection title="Tips for Using Your TDEE">
    <p>
      <strong>Track for 2-3 weeks</strong> before adjusting. Weigh yourself at the same time daily and
      use the weekly average. If your weight is stable, your TDEE estimate is accurate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Don't crash diet.</strong> Extreme deficits (over 1,000 cal below TDEE) cause muscle loss,
      metabolic adaptation, and are unsustainable. Aim for a moderate 500-calorie deficit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Recalculate every 10-15 lbs.</strong> As your weight changes, so does your TDEE. A lighter
      body burns fewer calories, so your deficit needs adjustment over time.
