  {
    question: "What is net worth and why does it matter?",
    answer: "Net worth is the total value of everything you own (assets) minus everything you owe (liabilities). It's the single best measure of your overall financial health. Tracking net worth over time shows whether you're building wealth or falling behind."
  },
  {
    question: "What should I include as assets?",
    answer: "Include all assets: cash and savings accounts, investment accounts (brokerage, IRAs, 401k), real estate (home value), vehicles, valuable personal property, and any other items of significant value. Use current market values, not what you paid."
  },
  {
    question: "What counts as a liability?",
    answer: "Liabilities include all debts: mortgage balance, auto loans, student loans, credit card balances, personal loans, medical debt, and any other money you owe. Include the current payoff amount, not the original loan amount."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a good net worth for my age?",
    answer: "A common rule of thumb is your net worth should equal your age × annual income ÷ 10. For example, a 30-year-old earning $50,000 should aim for $150,000. However, this varies widely based on location, career stage, and personal circumstances."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it normal to have negative net worth?",
    answer: "Yes, especially early in life. Recent graduates often have negative net worth due to student loans. Young homebuyers may also be 'underwater' initially. The key is trending positive over time as you pay down debt and build assets."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I include my home in net worth?",
    answer: "Yes, but be realistic about value. Use recent comparable sales, not Zillow estimates (which can be inflated). Some people calculate two net worths: one including home equity (total net worth) and one excluding it (liquid net worth)."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I calculate my net worth?",
    answer: "Monthly or quarterly tracking works well. This catches trends without obsessing over daily market fluctuations. Many people track on the 1st of each month. Consistent tracking dates make comparisons more meaningful."
  },
  {
    question: "What's a good debt-to-asset ratio?",
    answer: "Under 50% is generally considered healthy, meaning you own more than you owe. Under 30% is excellent. Over 100% means you have negative net worth. This ratio helps assess financial risk and borrowing capacity."

    <p>
      Your net worth is the foundation of financial planning. It tells you exactly where you stand financially,
      regardless of income or lifestyle. A high earner with massive debt may have lower net worth than a frugal
      saver with modest income.
