    question: 'How much should I budget for a vacation?',
    answer:
      'A good rule of thumb is $150-$250 per person per day for moderate domestic travel, including accommodation, food, and activities. International trips to expensive destinations can be $300-$500+ per person per day. Budget destinations might be $50-$100 per person per day.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What expenses do people forget to budget for?',
    answer:
      'Commonly forgotten costs: airport parking or rideshare, travel insurance, tips and gratuities, resort fees, baggage fees, phone/data plans abroad, souvenirs, laundry, and the "last night splurge" dinner. Add a 10-15% buffer for these surprises.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How can I save money on accommodation?',
    answer:
      'Options: book vacation rentals with kitchens (save on meals), travel during shoulder season, stay outside city centers, use hotel loyalty points, book directly for better rates, consider hostels or house-sitting, or try home exchanges.',
  },
  {
    question: 'When is the cheapest time to book flights?',
    answer:
      'Domestic flights: book 1-3 months ahead. International: 2-8 months ahead. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are often cheapest to fly. Use price alerts and be flexible with dates. January, February, and September are typically the cheapest months to travel.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I get travel insurance?',
    answer:
      'Travel insurance is recommended for: expensive trips ($5,000+), international travel, trips with non-refundable bookings, adventure activities, or if you have health concerns. It typically costs 4-8% of your trip cost and covers cancellation, medical emergencies, and lost luggage.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much should I budget for food while traveling?',
    answer:
      'Budget: $20-$40/day (grocery stores, street food). Moderate: $50-$80/day (mix of restaurants and self-catering). Upscale: $100-$200+/day (restaurants for most meals). Breakfast at accommodation and lunch as main meal can save significantly.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need a car rental?',
    answer:
      'Consider car rental if: visiting multiple destinations, staying outside city centers, traveling with kids/elderly, or destination has poor public transit. Skip it for: city trips with good transit, beach resorts, or European cities where parking is difficult/expensive.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I stick to my vacation budget?',
    answer:
      'Tips: use a daily spending allowance, track expenses with an app, pre-pay what you can (accommodation, tours), use local currency to avoid fees, eat where locals eat, take advantage of free activities, and save "splurge" money for one special experience.',

  <ContentSection title="How to Use This Calculator">
    <p>
      Start with the basics: <strong>number of travelers</strong> and <strong>nights</strong>.
      Remember, more nights means more daily expenses add up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select your <strong>destination type</strong> to get reasonable default costs. Customize these based
      on your research for specific locations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Choose your <strong>travel style</strong>. Budget travelers stay in hostels and cook meals.
      Luxury travelers stay at resorts and dine out for every meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adjust <strong>daily expenses</strong> based on actual research for your destination. Costs vary
      significantly between cities and countries.
    </p>
  </ContentSection>

  <ContentSection title="Understanding Your Results">
    <p>
      The <strong>total trip budget</strong> includes all categories plus a 10% contingency fund for unexpected
      expenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Per person per day</strong> is a useful metric to compare with travel guides and other travelers'
      experiences at your destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>savings plan</strong> shows how long it would take to save this amount if you put aside
      10% of a median income. Adjust your timeline based on your actual savings rate.
