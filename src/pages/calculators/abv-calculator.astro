  {
    question: "How do I measure original gravity (OG)?",
    answer: "Use a hydrometer or refractometer on cooled wort/must before adding yeast. For hydrometers, ensure the sample is at the calibration temperature (usually 60°F or 68°F). Take the reading at the bottom of the meniscus."
  },
  {
    question: "When should I take final gravity (FG)?",
    answer: "Take FG when fermentation is complete - typically when gravity readings are stable for 2-3 consecutive days. For beer, this is usually 1-2 weeks; wine and mead may take longer. Don't rush this step."
  },
  {
    question: "What does attenuation mean?",
    answer: "Attenuation is the percentage of sugars consumed by yeast. Higher attenuation (75-85%) means a drier, less sweet finish. Lower attenuation (65-75%) leaves residual sweetness. Different yeast strains have different attenuation ranges."
  },
  {
    question: "How accurate is the ABV formula?",
    answer: "The standard formula (OG-FG)×131.25 is accurate within 0.1-0.2% for typical beers. For very high gravity brews (above 1.080 OG), more complex formulas may be slightly more accurate. Our calculator is sufficient for all practical purposes."
  },
  {
    question: "Why is temperature correction important?",
    answer: "Hydrometers are calibrated at specific temperatures (usually 60°F or 68°F). Warmer samples read lower than actual; colder samples read higher. Temperature correction ensures accurate gravity readings if you can't cool your sample."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between ABV and ABW?",
    answer: "ABV (Alcohol By Volume) measures alcohol as a percentage of total volume. ABW (Alcohol By Weight) measures by mass. ABV is about 1.25× higher than ABW because alcohol is lighter than water. Most countries use ABV."

    <p>
      Specific gravity measures the density of liquid compared to water (1.000).
      Sugary wort/must has higher gravity; as yeast converts sugar to alcohol,
      gravity drops. The difference tells us how much alcohol was produced.
