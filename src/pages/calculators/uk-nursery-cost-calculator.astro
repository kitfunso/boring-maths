    answer:
      'Average UK nursery costs in 2025 range from £5.50-9.50 per hour depending on region and child age. Inner London is most expensive (£8.50-9.50/hr), while the rest of the UK averages £5.50-6.50/hr. Under-2s cost more due to higher staff ratios (1:3). Full-time care (50 hrs/week) can cost £12,000-25,000/year before government support.',

    question: 'What are the 30 free hours for working parents?',
    answer:
      'From September 2025, working parents in England can get 30 hours of free childcare per week for children aged 9 months to school age. Both parents (or single parent) must work at least 16 hours/week at National Minimum Wage and earn under £100,000/year each. The hours apply during term time (38 weeks) but can be stretched across more weeks.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do all 3-4 year olds get free childcare?',
    answer:
      "Yes, ALL 3-4 year olds in England are entitled to 15 hours of universal free childcare per week, regardless of parents' employment or income. This starts the term after your child turns 3 and continues until they start school. Working parents can get an additional 15 hours (30 total) if they meet the eligibility criteria.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What is Tax-Free Childcare and how does it work?',
    answer:
      'Tax-Free Childcare is a government scheme where for every £8 you pay into your childcare account, the government adds £2 - effectively a 20% top-up. The maximum contribution is £2,000 per child per year (£4,000 for disabled children). You must be working and earning at least £2,539/quarter but under £100,000/year. You cannot use it alongside Universal Credit or Tax Credits.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I get help with childcare costs on Universal Credit?',
    answer:
      'Yes, the Universal Credit childcare element covers up to 85% of your childcare costs, capped at £1,031.88/month for one child or £1,768.94/month for two or more children. You must be working and using a registered childcare provider. Note: You cannot claim UC childcare AND Tax-Free Childcare - you must choose one.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Why is childcare for under-2s more expensive?',
    answer:
      'UK nurseries must maintain a staff-to-child ratio of 1:3 for children under 2 years old, compared to 1:4 for 2-year-olds and 1:8 for 3-4 year olds. This means more staff are needed per child, significantly increasing costs. Under-2 care typically costs 10-20% more than care for older children.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I apply for free childcare hours?',
    answer:
      "For the universal 15 hours (3-4 year olds), you don't need to apply - just register with your childcare provider. For working parent hours (15/30 hours), apply via GOV.UK Childcare Service. You'll receive an 11-digit eligibility code to give to your provider. You must reconfirm your eligibility every 3 months.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I spread my free hours over the full year?',
    answer:
      'Free hours are funded for 38 term-time weeks per year. However, you can ask your provider to "stretch" these hours over more weeks (up to 52). For example, 30 hours x 38 weeks = 1,140 hours total, which could be 22 hours x 52 weeks. Not all providers offer stretching, so check with yours.',

  <ContentSection title="Understanding UK Childcare Costs in 2025">
    <p>
      Childcare is one of the biggest expenses for UK families with young children. In 2025, the
      <strong>average cost of full-time nursery care</strong> ranges from around £12,000 to over £25,000
      per year depending on your region and your child's age.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Key factors affecting nursery costs:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Region:</strong> Inner London is most expensive (£9.50/hr average for under-2s)
      </li>
      <li><strong>Child's age:</strong> Under-2s cost more due to stricter 1:3 staff ratios</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hours needed:</strong> Full-time vs part-time significantly impacts total cost
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Provider type:</strong> Private nurseries, childminders, and nannies have different rates
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The good news is that <strong>government support can reduce your costs significantly</strong>.
      Working parents may save £5,000-15,000 per year through free hours and Tax-Free Childcare.
    </p>

  <ContentSection title="Free Childcare Hours Explained">
    <p>
      The UK government offers <strong>funded childcare hours</strong> to help families with costs:
    </p>
    <h3>30 Hours for Working Parents (from September 2025)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Available for children aged <strong>9 months to school age</strong></li>
      <li>Both parents must work at least 16 hours/week at National Minimum Wage</li>
      <li>Each parent must earn under £100,000/year</li>
      <li>Single parents qualify if meeting the same work requirements</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>15 Universal Hours (All 3-4 Year Olds)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Available to <strong>all children</strong> from the term after they turn 3</li>
      <li>No work or income requirements</li>
      <li>Can be combined with working parent hours for 30 total</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>15 Hours for 2-Year-Olds (Low Income)</h3>

      <li>Also available if child has an EHCP or is looked after</li>
    </ul>
  </ContentSection>

  <ContentSection title="Tax-Free Childcare vs Universal Credit">
    <p>
      Two main schemes help with childcare costs beyond free hours, but <strong
        >you can only use one</strong
      >:
    </p>
    <h3>Tax-Free Childcare</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Government pays <strong>£2 for every £8</strong> you deposit (20% top-up)</li>
      <li>Maximum £2,000/year per child (£4,000 if disabled)</li>
      <li>Must be working and earning £10,000-100,000/year</li>
      <li>Cannot be used with Universal Credit or Tax Credits</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Universal Credit Childcare Element</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Covers <strong>85% of childcare costs</strong></li>
      <li>Up to £1,031.88/month for one child, £1,768.94 for two or more</li>
      <li>Must be working and using registered childcare</li>
      <li>Claimed as part of your UC payment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Which is better?</strong> For most families earning over £20,000, Tax-Free Childcare provides
      more support. UC childcare is better for lower-income families who qualify for full UC.
