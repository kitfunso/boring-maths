const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How do I convert Celsius to Fahrenheit?",
    answer: "To convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, multiply by 9/5 (or 1.8) and add 32. The formula is: °F = (°C × 9/5) + 32. For example, 20°C = (20 × 1.8) + 32 = 68°F."
  },
  {
    question: "How many feet are in a meter?",
    answer: "One meter equals approximately 3.281 feet. To convert meters to feet, multiply by 3.281. To convert feet to meters, multiply by 0.3048."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I convert pounds to kilograms?",
    answer: "To convert pounds to kilograms, multiply by 0.4536. For example, 150 pounds = 150 × 0.4536 = 68 kg. To convert kg to pounds, multiply by 2.205."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between US and UK gallons?",
    answer: "US gallons and UK (Imperial) gallons are different sizes. 1 US gallon = 3.785 liters, while 1 UK gallon = 4.546 liters. This converter uses US gallons."
  },
  {
    question: "How many centimeters are in an inch?",
    answer: "One inch equals exactly 2.54 centimeters. To convert inches to cm, multiply by 2.54. To convert cm to inches, divide by 2.54 (or multiply by 0.3937)."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I convert miles to kilometers?",
    answer: "Multiply miles by 1.609 to get kilometers. For example, 10 miles = 16.09 km. To convert km to miles, multiply by 0.621. A quick estimate: km is roughly 60% of miles."
  },
  {
    question: "What is absolute zero in Fahrenheit and Celsius?",
    answer: "Absolute zero is the coldest possible temperature where all molecular motion stops. It equals -273.15°C or -459.67°F (0 Kelvin). Nothing can be colder than absolute zero."
