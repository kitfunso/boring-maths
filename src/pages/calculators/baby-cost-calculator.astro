// FAQ data
const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'How much does a baby cost in the first year?',
    answer:
      'In the US, first-year baby costs typically range from $12,000 to $25,000+, depending on choices like childcare, feeding method, and whether you buy new or used gear. The biggest variables are childcare (if returning to work) and healthcare costs.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the biggest baby expenses?',
    answer:
      'The largest expenses are typically: (1) Childcare/lost income - often 50%+ of total costs, (2) Healthcare - delivery and well-baby visits, (3) Gear - car seat, stroller, crib, (4) Diapers - around $800-1,000/year for disposables, (5) Formula - $1,500-2,000/year if not breastfeeding.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is breastfeeding really free?',
    answer:
      "Breastfeeding significantly reduces feeding costs, but it's not completely free. Expenses include a breast pump ($50-300, often covered by insurance), nursing bras, pads, storage bags, and potentially lactation consultant visits. Still, it saves $1,000-2,000+ vs formula.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How much do diapers cost per month?',
    answer:
      'Disposable diapers cost $60-80/month on average. Newborns use 8-12 diapers/day, decreasing to 6-8 by age 1. Cloth diapers cost $300-500 upfront but save money long-term, especially if used for multiple children.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I buy new or used baby gear?',
    answer:
      'Many items can be safely bought used: clothes, toys, strollers, cribs (check recalls), and bouncers. Always buy NEW: car seats (safety standards and unknown crash history), mattresses (hygiene), and bottles/nipples. Used gear can save $2,000+ in the first year.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much maternity leave should I plan for?',
    answer:
      'In the US, FMLA provides 12 weeks unpaid leave if eligible. Many take 6-12 weeks. Budget for lost income if your leave is unpaid or partially paid. In the UK, statutory maternity pay covers 39 weeks at reduced rates.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What baby costs do people forget to budget for?',
    answer:
      'Commonly forgotten costs: (1) Health insurance premium increase to add baby, (2) Delivery out-of-pocket costs even with insurance, (3) Lost income during unpaid leave, (4) Baby-proofing the home, (5) More laundry = higher utility bills, (6) Photos and announcements.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How can I reduce baby costs?',
    answer:
      'Cost-saving strategies: (1) Accept hand-me-downs and buy used, (2) Breastfeed if possible, (3) Use cloth diapers, (4) Skip unnecessary gear (wipe warmers, etc.), (5) Delay purchases until you know what you need, (6) Register for essentials and request diapers/wipes as gifts.',

  <!-- How to Use Section -->
  <ContentSection title="How to Use This Calculator">
    <p>
      Start by selecting your <strong>childcare plan</strong>. If you'll return to work, choose
      daycare or nanny and specify how many months in the first year. Childcare is often the biggest
      expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Choose your <strong>feeding method</strong>. Breastfeeding reduces costs significantly, while
      formula can add $1,500+ to your first-year budget. Many parents use a combination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select <strong>diaper preference</strong>. Disposables are convenient but costly. Cloth
      diapers have higher upfront costs but save money over time, especially for multiple children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indicate whether you'll <strong>buy new or used gear</strong>. Hand-me-downs and secondhand
      items can save thousands. Just ensure car seats are new and unexpired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter your <strong>parental leave details</strong>. Lost income during unpaid or partially
      paid leave is often the largest "hidden" cost that new parents underestimate.

      surprise you with unanticipated needs.

    <p>
      The <strong>cost breakdown</strong> shows where your money goes. For most families, childcare or
      lost income dominates. Use this to identify where to focus savings efforts.
