    Our home improvement calculators help DIYers and homeowners plan projects accurately.
    Nothing's worse than running out of paint mid-wall or buying too many boxes of flooring.
    Get your quantities right the first time.

  <p>
    These calculators account for real-world factors like waste percentages, coverage rates,
    and installation patterns. Whether you're painting a room, laying flooring, or spreading
    mulch, you'll know exactly what to buy.

  <h3>DIY Pro Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Paint Coverage:</strong> One gallon covers ~350-400 sq ft per coat on smooth walls, less on textured</li>
    <li><strong>Flooring Waste:</strong> Add 10% for straight patterns, 15% for diagonal, 20-25% for herringbone</li>
    <li><strong>Mulch Depth:</strong> 2-3 inches is ideal - too deep can suffocate plants and harbor pests</li>
    <li><strong>Electricity Costs:</strong> Space heaters and AC units are often the biggest power draws in a home</li>
  </ul>
