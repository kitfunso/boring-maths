  {
    question: 'How much food do I need for a graduation party?',
    answer:
      'For an open house style party (guests come and go): plan 8-10 finger food pieces per person. For a sit-down meal: 1-1.25 pounds of food per person total. Include a mix of proteins, sides, and appetizers. Always have 10-15% extra.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the best time to have a graduation open house?',
    answer:
      "2-5 PM is ideal for an open house - it bridges lunch and dinner so guests aren't expecting a full meal. This also allows you to attend other graduation parties. Weekend afternoons see the best attendance.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does a graduation party cost?',
    answer:
      'A simple home open house: $200-$500. A catered backyard party: $500-$1,500. A venue party: $1,000-$3,000+. Per-person costs range from $10-35 depending on food choices and whether you DIY or hire caterers.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What food should I serve at a graduation party?',
    answer:
      'Popular options: sandwich/slider bar, taco bar, BBQ, pasta salads, fruit and veggie trays, chips and dips. Include a graduation cake or cupcakes. Easy finger foods work best for open house style parties.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How many people should I invite?',
    answer:
      'Consider: family, close friends, classmates, teachers, neighbors, coworkers of parents. For open houses, invite more than you expect - typically 60-70% will attend. Stagger invitation times if space is limited.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What decorations do I need?',
    answer:
      'Essential: congratulations banner, balloons in school colors, photo display of graduate. Nice to have: themed tablecloths and napkins, memory board, achievement display, centerpieces. School colors make decorating easy.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I hire a caterer?',
    answer:
      'Caterers make sense for 40+ guests or if you want to enjoy the party. DIY works well for smaller gatherings and saves 40-60%. Consider a hybrid: cater the main dishes, DIY the sides and desserts.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I handle gifts at a graduation party?',
    answer:
      'Set up a card/gift table near the entrance with a basket for cards. Some families provide addressed thank-you cards for guests to fill out. Open gifts after the party, not during. Send thank-you notes within 2 weeks.',
