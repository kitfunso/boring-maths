// FAQ data
const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'How do I convert hourly wage to annual salary?',
    answer:
      'Multiply your hourly rate by the number of hours you work per week, then multiply by 52 (weeks per year). For example, $20/hour × 40 hours × 52 weeks = $41,600 annual salary. Our calculator also factors in taxes and overtime if applicable.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the formula for hourly to salary?',
    answer:
      'The basic formula is: Annual Salary = Hourly Rate × Hours Per Week × Weeks Per Year. For a standard full-time schedule: Salary = Hourly Rate × 40 × 52 = Hourly Rate × 2,080. This gives you gross annual income before taxes.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much is $20 an hour annually?',
    answer:
      '$20 per hour working 40 hours per week for 52 weeks equals $41,600 per year before taxes. After typical taxes (25%), take-home would be approximately $31,200. Adjust for your actual tax rate and time off for accurate numbers.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much is $15 an hour per year?',
    answer:
      '$15 per hour at full-time (40 hours/week, 52 weeks) equals $31,200 gross annual salary. After taxes of about 20-25%, expect take-home pay of roughly $23,400-$24,960 per year.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I include overtime in salary calculations?',
    answer:
      'Yes, if you regularly work overtime. Overtime is typically paid at 1.5x your regular rate (time and a half) for hours over 40 per week. Some jobs pay 2x (double time) for holidays or excessive hours. Include consistent overtime for accurate annual projections.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I calculate bi-weekly pay from hourly?',
    answer:
      'Multiply your hourly rate by hours worked per week, then multiply by 2 (for two weeks). For example: $25/hour × 40 hours × 2 weeks = $2,000 gross bi-weekly pay. There are 26 bi-weekly pay periods per year.',
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between gross and net salary?",
    answer:
      'Gross salary is your total earnings before any deductions. Net salary (take-home pay) is what you actually receive after taxes, Social Security, Medicare, and other deductions. Net is typically 20-35% less than gross depending on your tax bracket.',

  <ContentSection title="How to Use This Calculator">
    <p>
      Enter your <strong>hourly rate</strong> - this is the amount you're paid for each hour of work before
      any taxes or deductions. If you're not sure, check your pay stub or employment contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specify your <strong>hours per week</strong>. Full-time is typically 40 hours, but enter your
      actual hours if you work part-time or extended hours regularly. This doesn't include overtime
      - that's calculated separately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adjust <strong>weeks per year</strong> to account for unpaid time off. If you get paid vacation,
      keep it at 52. If you take 2 weeks unpaid, change it to 50 for more accurate annual projections.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you regularly work overtime, enable the <strong>overtime toggle</strong>
      and enter your typical overtime hours. Select the overtime rate multiplier (1.5x is standard in
      the US).
    </p>

  <ContentSection title="Understanding Your Results">
    <p>
      <strong>Annual salary</strong> shows your total yearly earnings. The gross amount is before taxes,
      while net is your take-home pay after estimated taxes. Actual taxes vary based on deductions and
      filing status.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Monthly income</strong> is your annual salary divided by 12 months. This is useful for budgeting
      monthly expenses like rent, utilities, and subscriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bi-weekly pay</strong> represents what you'd receive every two weeks (26 pay periods per
      year). Many employers pay bi-weekly, making this figure helpful for paycheck-to-paycheck planning.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Weekly pay</strong> is your gross and net for each week of work. Compare this to your actual
      paycheck to verify the calculator matches your real earnings.
