    Our automotive calculators help you make informed decisions about vehicle ownership. Whether
    you're considering an electric vehicle, deciding between buying or leasing, or tracking your
    carbon footprint, these tools provide the data you need.

    The EV vs Gas calculator accounts for purchase price, fuel/electricity costs, maintenance,
    insurance, and available tax credits to give you a complete picture of ownership costs over
    time.

  <h3>Key Considerations When Comparing Vehicles</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Total Cost of Ownership:</strong> Include purchase price, fuel, maintenance, insurance,
      and depreciation
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>EV Tax Credits:</strong> Federal credits up to $7,500 (US) can significantly reduce EV purchase
      costs
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Electricity Rates:</strong> Home charging is typically 3-4x cheaper than public fast charging
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Maintenance Savings:</strong> EVs have fewer moving parts, resulting in lower maintenance
      costs
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Break-Even Point:</strong> The time it takes for an EV's lower operating costs to offset
      its higher purchase price
    </li>
  </ul>

      Note: Actual costs vary based on your location, driving habits, electricity rates, and
      specific vehicle models. Use these calculators as a starting point for your research.
