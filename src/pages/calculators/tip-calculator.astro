// FAQ data
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How much should I tip at a restaurant?",
    answer: "In the US, 15-20% is standard for restaurant service. 15% indicates adequate service, 18% is typical for good service, and 20% or more shows appreciation for excellent service. In other countries, tipping customs vary significantly - in some places, service is included in the bill."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I calculate a 20% tip quickly?",
    answer: "To calculate 20% quickly: move the decimal point one place left (that's 10%), then double it. For example, on a $45 bill: 10% is $4.50, doubled is $9.00. For 15%, find 10% and add half. For 18%, find 20% and subtract a bit."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I tip on the total before or after tax?",
    answer: "Technically, you should tip on the pre-tax amount since tax goes to the government, not the server. However, many people tip on the post-tax total for convenience. The difference is usually small - do what feels right to you."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I split a bill fairly between friends?",
    answer: "The simplest method is to divide the total (including tip) equally. If people ordered significantly different amounts, you can split the bill proportionally or have each person calculate their share plus tip. Using a calculator makes this much easier."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to tip for takeout orders?",
    answer: "Tipping for takeout is optional but increasingly common. 10-15% is appropriate if you want to tip, especially for large or complex orders. During the pandemic, many people started tipping more for takeout to support restaurant workers."
  },
  {
    question: "How much should I tip for delivery?",
    answer: "For food delivery, 15-20% of the order total is standard, with a minimum of $3-5 for small orders. Consider tipping more for bad weather, long distances, large orders, or if the driver had to climb stairs to reach you."

      Enter your <strong>bill amount</strong> (before tip) to get started. The calculator
      will instantly show you tip amounts for common percentages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the <strong>tip percentage slider</strong> or quick-select buttons to choose
      your preferred tip amount. The slider allows fine-grained control from 0% to 50%.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're dining with friends, use the <strong>split between</strong> control to
      divide the bill equally. The calculator shows both per-person and total amounts.

      The <strong>quick reference table</strong> shows tip amounts for 15%, 18%, 20%, and
      25% - click any row to select that tip percentage.

    <p>
      <strong>15%</strong> - Adequate service. The server did their job but nothing
      exceptional. This is the minimum for acceptable service in the US.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>18%</strong> - Good service. Your server was attentive, friendly, and
      efficient. This is becoming the new "standard" tip in many areas.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>20%</strong> - Great service. Your server went above and beyond, making
      your dining experience memorable. This is the expected tip for good service.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>25%+</strong> - Exceptional service. Reserve this for truly outstanding
      experiences or to show extra appreciation for servers during difficult situations.
