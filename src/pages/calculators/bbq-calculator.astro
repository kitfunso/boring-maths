  {
    question: 'How much meat per person for a BBQ?',
    answer:
      'Plan for 1/3 to 3/4 pound of raw meat per person depending on appetite. Light eaters: 1/3 lb (5 oz). Average appetites: 1/2 lb (8 oz). Hearty eaters: 3/4 lb (12 oz). For kids under 12, plan for about half of adult portions.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much hamburger meat for 20 people?',
    answer:
      'For 20 people with standard 1/4 lb burger patties, buy 6-7 pounds of ground beef. This allows for about 1.5 burgers per person plus some extra. Buy more if burgers are the only main dish or if you expect hearty appetites.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How many hot dogs per person?',
    answer:
      'Adults typically eat 1.5-2 hot dogs each, while children eat about 1. For a mixed crowd, plan for 1.5 hot dogs per person on average. Hot dogs are usually a secondary item alongside burgers, so you can reduce this if offering multiple proteins.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much charcoal do I need?',
    answer:
      "For a typical cookout, use about 30 briquettes per pound of meat, or roughly 1 pound of charcoal per pound of meat. For a 3-4 hour cookout with 10 lbs of meat, you'll need about 10-15 lbs of charcoal. Add more for low-and-slow cooking.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How far in advance should I buy meat for a BBQ?',
    answer:
      'Fresh ground beef: 1-2 days ahead. Steaks and chops: 3-5 days ahead. Whole chickens: 1-2 days ahead. Ribs and larger cuts: 3-5 days ahead. For larger events, consider ordering from a butcher a week ahead to ensure you get enough.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What sides go best with BBQ?',
    answer:
      'Classic BBQ sides include: coleslaw, baked beans, potato salad, corn on the cob, mac and cheese, and green salad. Plan for 2-4 sides per person, with about 1/2 cup of each side dish. Having 3-4 different options gives variety without overwhelming.',

    <p>
      Enter your <strong>total guest count</strong> and how many are <strong>children</strong>
      (under 12). Children typically eat about half of adult portions, so this helps calculate accurate
      amounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select the <strong>appetite level</strong> based on your crowd. Light is good for events with lots
      of appetizers or a hot day. Hungry is for big eaters or active outdoor events.
    </p>
    <p>
      Choose your <strong>main meat type</strong> - this determines the specific cuts in your shopping
      list. "Mixed" gives you a classic variety of burgers, chicken, ribs, and hot dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adjust the <strong>number of side dishes</strong> and <strong>event duration</strong>
      to fine-tune your planning.
    </p>
  </ContentSection>

  <!-- Understanding Results Section -->
  <ContentSection title="Understanding Your Results">
    <p>
      The <strong>meat shopping list</strong> breaks down exactly how much of each cut to buy, including
      an automatic 10% buffer for trimming and seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Side dishes</strong> are calculated based on standard portions. Feel free to adjust based
      on your specific recipes and what you know your guests like.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>supplies checklist</strong> covers paper goods and serving essentials. Check off items
      as you shop. Consider buying 10-15% extra supplies for spills and accidents.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Grilling info</strong> helps you plan fuel (charcoal or propane) and estimate cooking time.
      Start earlier than you think - you can always keep food warm, but you can't speed up the grill.
