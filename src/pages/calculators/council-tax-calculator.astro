  {
    question: 'How is council tax calculated?',
    answer:
      'Council tax is based on the valuation band of your property (A to H) and the Band D rate set by your local council. Each band has a fixed ratio to Band D: Band A is 6/9ths, Band B is 7/9ths, up to Band H which is 2× the Band D rate. Your council sets the Band D rate annually based on its spending needs.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the council tax bands?',
    answer:
      'In England, properties are banded A–H based on their value on 1 April 1991. Band A: up to £40,000, Band B: £40,001–£52,000, Band C: £52,001–£68,000, Band D: £68,001–£88,000, Band E: £88,001–£120,000, Band F: £120,001–£160,000, Band G: £160,001–£320,000, Band H: over £320,000.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the single person discount?',
    answer:
      'If you are the only adult living in a property (not counting students, carers, or severely mentally impaired people), you qualify for a 25% discount on your council tax. You need to apply to your local council to receive this discount.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the second home council tax premium?',
    answer:
      'From April 2025, councils in England can charge up to 100% extra council tax on second homes (doubling the bill). This is enabled by the Levelling Up and Regeneration Act 2023. Some councils had already been charging premiums where local rules allowed.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I challenge my council tax band?',
    answer:
      'Yes, you can challenge your council tax band if you believe your property is in the wrong band. Contact the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) in England and Wales, or the Scottish Assessors Association in Scotland. Check similar properties in your area on the VOA website for comparison.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Are there other council tax discounts available?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Full-time students get 100% exemption. Properties left empty may get discounts (though many councils now charge premiums on long-term empty homes). People with disabilities may get a reduction, and council tax support (formerly council tax benefit) is available for people on low incomes.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I pay council tax?',
    answer:
      'Council tax is usually paid in 10 monthly instalments from April to January, though you can request to pay over 12 months. Payment methods include direct debit, online banking, and at the Post Office. Most councils offer a discount for paying the full year upfront.',

  <ContentSection title="Understanding Council Tax Bands">
    <div class="space-y-4 text-[var(--color-subtle)]">
      <p>
        Council tax bands are based on <strong class="text-[var(--color-cream)]"
          >property values as of 1 April 1991</strong
        >
        in England and Scotland (1 April 2003 in Wales). The banding system means your tax isn't directly
        proportional to your property's current value.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong class="text-[var(--color-cream)]">Band D rate</strong> is the reference point. Band
        A pays two-thirds of Band D, while Band H pays double. This means the difference between the cheapest
        and most expensive band is only 3:1, despite massive differences in property values.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="text-emerald-400">Regional variation</strong> is significant – London tends to
        have lower council tax rates despite higher property values, while northern councils and rural
        areas often charge more due to different funding models.
