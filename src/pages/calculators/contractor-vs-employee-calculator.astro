// FAQ data
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What's the difference between 1099 and W2 employment?",
    answer:
      'W2 employees work for a single employer who withholds taxes, provides benefits, and pays half of Social Security/Medicare taxes (7.65%). 1099 contractors are self-employed - they set their own rates and hours but must pay the full 15.3% self-employment tax, provide their own benefits, and handle their own taxes. Contractors typically need higher gross income to net the same as employees after accounting for these costs.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much higher should my contractor rate be than an equivalent salary?',
    answer:
      "As a general rule, your contractor hourly rate should be 1.3x to 1.5x the equivalent W2 hourly rate to break even. For example, if a job pays $50/hour as an employee ($104K salary), you'd need $65-75/hour as a contractor. This covers the extra 7.65% self-employment tax, health insurance costs, lack of paid time off, retirement match, and business expenses. Our calculator provides exact numbers for your situation.",
  },
  {
    question: "What costs do contractors have that employees don't?",
    answer:
      'Contractors face several hidden costs: 1) Self-employment tax - the extra 7.65% employer portion of FICA (Social Security + Medicare). 2) Health insurance - often $500-800/month for a family without employer subsidy. 3) Retirement contributions without matching - employees often get 3-6% free match. 4) No paid time off - vacation time is unpaid. 5) Business expenses - software, equipment, liability insurance, accounting fees. 6) Unpaid non-billable hours - admin, marketing, invoicing.',
  },
  {
    question: "What benefits do employees get that contractors don't?",
    answer:
      'Employee benefits can add 20-40% to base salary in value: 1) Employer-paid health insurance ($6,000-15,000/year value). 2) 401(k) match (3-6% of salary). 3) Paid time off (2-4 weeks + holidays = $4,000-12,000 value). 4) Life and disability insurance. 5) Dental and vision coverage. 6) Education reimbursement. 7) Stock options or RSUs. 8) Gym memberships, commuter benefits, etc. The calculator accounts for all these factors.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I calculate the value of my employee benefits?',
    answer:
      "Check your benefits statement or HR portal for exact numbers. For health insurance, find the 'employer contribution' (often $500-1500/month). For 401k match, multiply your salary by the match percentage (e.g., $100K × 4% = $4,000). For PTO value, divide salary by 260 working days and multiply by PTO days. Add dental/vision (usually $50-100/month), life insurance, and any other perks. Most employees underestimate their total compensation by 20-30%.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the self-employment tax and how does it work?',
    answer:
      "Self-employment tax is 15.3% on net self-employment income - it covers Social Security (12.4%) and Medicare (2.9%). As an employee, you pay half (7.65%) and your employer pays half. As a contractor, you pay both halves. You can deduct half of SE tax from your taxable income, and it's calculated on 92.35% of net earnings. For high earners, the 12.4% Social Security portion caps at $160,200 (2023), but the 2.9% Medicare continues on all income.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I form an LLC or S-Corp as a contractor?',
    answer:
      "An LLC provides liability protection but doesn't change tax treatment - you still pay full self-employment tax. An S-Corp can reduce SE tax if you earn over $80-100K: you pay yourself a 'reasonable salary' (which has SE tax) and take remaining profit as distributions (no SE tax). The savings can be $5,000-15,000/year, but you'll have added complexity, payroll costs, and must pay yourself consistently. Consult a tax professional for your specific situation.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How many billable hours should I plan for?',
    answer:
      'Most contractors can bill 30-35 hours per week on average, not 40. The remaining time goes to: finding work, invoicing, admin tasks, professional development, and marketing. Plan for 1,500-1,800 billable hours per year (vs. 2,080 for a full-time employee). Also factor in unpaid time off - most contractors take 2-4 weeks vacation plus sick days. Our calculator uses weeks per year to account for this.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What business expenses can contractors deduct?',
    answer:
      'Common deductible business expenses include: home office (dedicated space), computer and equipment, software subscriptions, professional liability insurance, accounting and legal fees, business travel, professional development, health insurance premiums (special deduction), cell phone (business portion), internet (business portion), coworking space, and retirement contributions (SEP-IRA or Solo 401k). Keep detailed records and receipts for all deductions.',
  },
  {
    question: 'When does contracting make financial sense?',
    answer:
      "Contracting often makes sense when: 1) Your rate is 1.4x+ equivalent salary. 2) You have access to spouse's health insurance. 3) You value flexibility over stability. 4) You're in a high-demand field with steady work. 5) You're building toward your own business. It may not make sense when: 1) Rate difference is small. 2) Benefits are excellent (good insurance, high 401k match). 3) You value job security. 4) Work is inconsistent. 5) You dislike admin/business tasks.",

  <!-- How to Use Section -->
  <ContentSection title="How to Use This Calculator">
    <p>
      Start by entering your <strong>contractor details</strong> on the left: your hourly rate, expected
      billable hours per week, and weeks you'll work per year (accounting for unpaid time off). The calculator
      shows your annual gross income based on these inputs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Add your <strong>contractor costs</strong>: monthly health insurance premiums, retirement
      contribution percentage (for SEP-IRA or Solo 401k), and business expenses like software,
      equipment, and coworking. Include annual costs for accounting and professional liability
      insurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter the <strong>employee offer</strong> on the right: base salary and annual bonus percentage.
      Add the benefits: 401(k) match percentage and limit, what the employer pays for health insurance
      (check your benefits statement), and other insurance coverage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't forget <strong>paid time off</strong> - this has real value! Enter both PTO days and paid
      holidays. Also add any other annual benefits like stock grants, education reimbursement, or gym
      memberships.
    </p>
    <p>
      Open <strong>Tax Settings</strong> to customize your marginal federal tax bracket, state tax rate,
      and self-employment tax rate (15.3% in the US). The calculator uses these to compute accurate net
      income for both scenarios.
    </p>
  </ContentSection>

  <!-- Understanding Results Section -->
  <ContentSection title="Understanding Your Results">
    <p>
      The <strong>winner comparison</strong> shows which option gives you more net annual income after
      all taxes and costs. The annual and monthly difference helps you see the real impact on your finances.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Effective hourly rates</strong> tell the real story. For contractors, it's net income divided
      by billable hours - often much lower than the headline rate. For employees, it's net income divided
      by actual work hours (excluding PTO).
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>break-even analysis</strong> is crucial for negotiations. It shows the minimum contractor
      rate to match the employee total compensation, and the salary an employee would need to match the
      contractor net income.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>detailed comparison table</strong> breaks down every component: where your money comes
      from and where it goes. Green numbers are income/benefits, red numbers are costs/taxes. This helps
      identify which factors matter most in your specific comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Review the <strong>key metrics</strong> at the bottom: hours worked comparison, total benefits value
      you'd be giving up (or gaining), self-employment tax burden, and contractor business costs. These
      often-overlooked factors can swing the decision significantly.
    </p>

  <!-- Strategy Section -->
  <ContentSection title="Making the Right Choice">
    <p>
      <strong>It's not just about money.</strong> Contracting offers flexibility, variety, and potentially
      higher income - but comes with instability, admin overhead, and isolation. Employment offers stability,
      benefits, and career growth paths - but less control and potentially lower ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Negotiate from a position of knowledge.</strong> If contracting, know your break-even rate
      and add a margin for risk and value. If taking an employee role, understand the true value of benefits
      - many people underestimate them by $20-40K.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Consider the transition costs.</strong> Switching from employee to contractor means losing
      benefits immediately. You may need COBRA coverage (expensive) for a few months. Build an emergency
      fund before making the leap.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Think about your career stage.</strong> Early career often benefits from employee roles
      for mentorship, training, and resume building. Mid-career professionals with established skills
      and networks often thrive as contractors.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Factor in tax optimization.</strong> Contractors have more tax flexibility - retirement
      accounts (SEP-IRA, Solo 401k), business deductions, and potentially S-Corp election can improve
      the math significantly. Consult a tax professional.
