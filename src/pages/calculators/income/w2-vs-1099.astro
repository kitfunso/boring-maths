    question: 'What is the difference between W2 and 1099?',
    answer:
      'A W2 employee works for a company that withholds income taxes, pays half of Social Security and Medicare taxes (7.65%), and typically provides benefits like health insurance and paid time off. A 1099 contractor is self-employed, pays the full 15.3% self-employment tax, arranges their own benefits, and has more flexibility in how and when they work.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much more should a 1099 contractor make than a W2 employee?',
    answer:
      'A 1099 contractor should charge at least 1.25x to 1.5x the equivalent W2 hourly rate to break even after accounting for self-employment tax, health insurance, retirement match, paid time off, and business expenses. For roles with generous benefits packages, 1.4x to 1.5x is more appropriate. Use our W2 to 1099 Calculator for your exact multiplier.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is self-employment tax and how much is it?',
    answer:
      'Self-employment tax is 15.3% on net self-employment income, covering Social Security (12.4% up to $168,600 in 2024) and Medicare (2.9% on all earnings). As a W2 employee, your employer pays half (7.65%). As a 1099 contractor, you pay both halves. You can deduct half of the SE tax from your adjusted gross income.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I switch from W2 to 1099 at the same job?',
    answer:
      'Sometimes, but be cautious. The IRS has strict rules about worker classification. If a company controls when, where, and how you work, you are likely an employee regardless of what label they use. Misclassification can result in penalties for the employer and lost protections for you. Genuine 1099 arrangements involve real independence in how work is performed.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What tax deductions can 1099 contractors take?',
    answer:
      'Common deductions include: home office (dedicated workspace), health insurance premiums, retirement contributions (SEP-IRA or Solo 401k), business equipment and software, professional development, business travel, cell phone and internet (business portion), accounting and legal fees, and professional liability insurance. The qualified business income deduction (QBI) can also reduce taxable income by up to 20%.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I form an LLC or S-Corp as a contractor?',
    answer:
      'An LLC provides liability protection but does not change your tax treatment. An S-Corp can save on self-employment tax if you earn over $80,000-$100,000 per year by splitting income between salary (subject to SE tax) and distributions (not subject to SE tax). However, S-Corps add complexity, require payroll, and have ongoing compliance costs. Consult a tax professional for your specific situation.',

  <ContentSection title="When Does 1099 Make Financial Sense?">
    <p>
      Contracting makes the most financial sense when the rate premium is significant and you can
      manage costs effectively. Here are the scenarios where it typically works:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-3 text-[var(--color-subtle)]">
      <li>
        <strong class="text-[var(--color-cream)]">High rate premium:</strong> The contract rate is 1.4x
        or more than the equivalent salary, leaving room for costs plus extra income.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong class="text-[var(--color-cream)]">Spouse's benefits:</strong> Access to health insurance
        through a partner eliminates one of the biggest contractor costs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong class="text-[var(--color-cream)]">High-demand skills:</strong> Fields like software engineering,
        data science, and specialized consulting have steady demand and premium rates.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong class="text-[var(--color-cream)]">Tax optimization:</strong> S-Corp election, business
        deductions, and retirement contributions can significantly improve the after-tax picture for higher
        earners.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong class="text-[var(--color-cream)]">Multiple clients:</strong> Working with several clients
        reduces the risk of income loss from any single engagement ending.
