  <h3>Key Income Insights</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Freelance Premium:</strong> Freelancers typically need to charge 1.5-2x their employee rate
      to account for benefits, taxes, and unbillable time
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Raise Compounding:</strong> A 5% raise compounds over your career - missing one early costs
      more than missing one later
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>True Hourly Rate:</strong> Divide your salary by actual hours worked (including commute,
      overtime) for reality check
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Go Full-Time Threshold:</strong> Most experts recommend 3-6 months runway + side income
      covering 75%+ of expenses
    </li>
  </ul>
