// FAQ data
const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'What is cost-plus pricing?',
    answer:
      'Cost-plus pricing adds a fixed markup to your total costs. For example, if your product costs $20 and you want a 50% margin, you price at $40. It is simple and ensures profitability, but may leave money on the table if customers would pay more.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is value-based pricing?',
    answer:
      'Value-based pricing sets prices based on the perceived value to customers rather than your costs. If customers see your product as worth $100, you might price at $70-80 regardless of whether it costs you $10 or $50 to make.',
  },
  {
    question: 'When should I use competitive pricing?',
    answer:
      'Competitive pricing works well in commodity markets where products are similar. Match or slightly undercut competitors to win on price. However, this can lead to race-to-the-bottom dynamics and thin margins.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is a good profit margin?',
    answer:
      'It varies by industry. Software typically achieves 70-90% gross margins. Retail sees 30-50%. Restaurants average 60-70% on food. Compare your margin to industry benchmarks and ensure it covers all costs plus desired profit.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I determine perceived value?',
    answer:
      'Research your target customers through surveys, interviews, and competitor analysis. Ask what they currently pay for alternatives, what problems your product solves, and how much those problems cost them. The value of solving a $10,000 problem is worth more than solving a $100 problem.',
  },
