  {
    question: 'What is LBTT in Scotland?',
    answer:
      "Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) is Scotland's property purchase tax, replacing UK Stamp Duty from April 2015. It's administered by Revenue Scotland. LBTT is a progressive tax — you only pay the higher rate on the portion of the price within each band.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the current LBTT rates?',
    answer:
      'LBTT rates are: 0% up to £145,000 (£175,000 for first-time buyers), 2% from £145,001–£250,000, 5% from £250,001–£325,000, 10% from £325,001–£750,000, and 12% above £750,000.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is there first-time buyer relief in Scotland?',
    answer:
      'Yes, first-time buyers in Scotland benefit from an increased nil-rate band of £175,000 (compared to £145,000 for other buyers). This can save up to £600 on your LBTT bill. You must not have previously owned a property anywhere in the world.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the Additional Dwelling Supplement (ADS)?',
    answer:
      "The ADS is an extra 6% tax on the total purchase price when buying an additional residential property in Scotland worth £40,000 or more. This applies to second homes, buy-to-let properties, and holiday homes. It's paid on top of LBTT.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How does LBTT compare to English stamp duty?',
    answer:
      "LBTT has lower starting thresholds (£145,000 vs £250,000 for SDLT) but different band structures. Scotland's ADS at 6% is higher than England's additional property surcharge of 5%. Overall costs vary by property price and buyer type.",
  },
  {
    question: 'When do I need to pay LBTT?',
    answer:
      'LBTT must be paid within 30 days of the effective date of the transaction (usually the date of entry/settlement). Your solicitor normally handles the LBTT return and payment on your behalf through Revenue Scotland.',

      <p>
        Scotland's LBTT has <strong class="text-[var(--color-cream)]"
          >lower starting thresholds</strong
        >
        than England's SDLT. The nil-rate band starts at £145,000 (vs £250,000 in England), meaning you
        start paying tax sooner.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, LBTT is a <strong class="text-[var(--color-cream)]">truly progressive tax</strong> —
        like income tax, you only pay the higher rate on the portion within each band. This means the
        jump between bands is smoother than the old "slab" system.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong class="text-amber-400">ADS at 6%</strong> is higher than England's 5% surcharge for
        additional properties, making second homes more expensive in Scotland relative to England.
