    question: 'How much does a dog cost per year?',
    answer:
      'A dog typically costs $1,000-$3,000+ per year depending on size, health, and lifestyle. Large dogs cost more for food and medication. Major expenses include food ($300-900), vet care ($200-600), grooming ($0-500), and supplies ($200-400).',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does a cat cost per year?',
    answer:
      "Cats typically cost $500-$1,500 per year. They're generally less expensive than dogs due to smaller food portions and fewer grooming needs. Key costs include food ($200-400), litter ($150-300), vet care ($200-500), and supplies ($100-200).",
  },
  {
    question: 'Is pet insurance worth it?',
    answer:
      "Pet insurance can be worth it if your pet develops a chronic condition or needs emergency surgery (often $3,000-$10,000+). It's most cost-effective when purchased young before pre-existing conditions develop. Consider your emergency fund vs insurance premiums.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the hidden costs of pet ownership?',
    answer:
      'Often-forgotten costs include: emergency vet visits ($500-5,000+), dental cleanings ($200-700), pet deposits/rent ($200-500/year), travel boarding ($25-75/night), damaged furniture/belongings, and time off work for vet appointments.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much should I budget for vet emergencies?',
    answer:
      'Financial experts recommend an emergency fund of $1,000-5,000 for pets, depending on size and breed. Large dogs and breeds prone to health issues need larger funds. Alternatively, comprehensive pet insurance can provide this protection.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do pet costs change with age?',
    answer:
      'Senior pets (7+ years for dogs, 10+ for cats) typically cost 20-50% more due to increased vet visits, medications for arthritis or other conditions, special diets, and dental care. Insurance premiums also increase with age.',
  },
  {
    question: "What's the lifetime cost of owning a dog?",
    answer:
      'The lifetime cost of a dog ranges from $15,000-$50,000+ depending on size, lifespan (10-15 years), and care level. Small dogs often cost less overall due to lower food and medication costs, despite sometimes living longer.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How can I reduce pet ownership costs?',
    answer:
      'Cost-saving tips: (1) Buy food in bulk, (2) Learn basic grooming, (3) Use preventative care to avoid expensive treatments, (4) Compare vet prices, (5) Consider pet insurance while young, (6) Ask about generic medications, (7) DIY toys from household items.',

  <ContentSection title="How to Use This Calculator">
    <p>
      Select your <strong>pet type</strong> to see breed-appropriate cost estimates. For dogs, specify
      the size as this significantly impacts food and medication costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter your pet's <strong>age and health status</strong>. Older pets and those with health
      issues typically have higher veterinary costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Choose your <strong>lifestyle options</strong>: premium vs standard food, professional
      grooming frequency, daycare usage, and boarding needs when you travel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toggle <strong>pet insurance</strong> on or off to see how it affects your annual costs. Insurance
      is typically most valuable for accident-prone pets or breeds with known health issues.
    </p>
  </ContentSection>

  <ContentSection title="Understanding Your Results">
    <p>
      The <strong>annual cost</strong> shows your expected yearly spending. The <strong
        >lifetime cost</strong
      > estimates total spending over your pet's remaining expected lifespan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>cost breakdown</strong> shows where your money goes. Food and veterinary care are typically
      the largest categories.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>emergency fund recommendation</strong> suggests how much to set aside for unexpected
      vet bills. This is in addition to your regular pet budget.
