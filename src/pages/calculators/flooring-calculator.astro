// FAQ data
const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'How much flooring waste should I allow?',
    answer:
      'Waste allowance depends on your installation pattern. Straight/parallel patterns need 10% extra, diagonal patterns need 15%, herringbone needs 20%, and chevron patterns need 25%. This accounts for cuts at walls, mistakes, and damaged pieces.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I calculate square footage for flooring?',
    answer:
      "Multiply the room's length by its width in feet. For example, a 15x12 foot room is 180 square feet. Add closets and other areas separately, then add your waste percentage based on the installation pattern.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How many boxes of flooring do I need?',
    answer:
      'Divide your total square footage (including waste) by the square feet per box (usually printed on the box, typically 20-25 sq ft). Always round up to the next whole box. For example, 200 sq ft ÷ 22 sq ft/box = 9.1, so buy 10 boxes.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Why does diagonal flooring need more waste?',
    answer:
      'Diagonal installation (45-degree angle) creates more angled cuts where the flooring meets walls. Each wall intersection requires a custom-cut piece, and more of each plank gets trimmed off compared to straight installation.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need underlayment for all flooring types?',
    answer:
      'Underlayment is recommended for laminate, engineered hardwood, and luxury vinyl plank. It provides cushioning, sound absorption, and moisture protection. Tile uses a different substrate (backer board), and most carpet has attached padding.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How many transition strips do I need?',
    answer:
      "Count each doorway where flooring meets different flooring, carpet, or tile. You'll also need transitions where flooring meets exterior doors. Standard doorways are 3 feet wide and require one strip each.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I buy extra boxes for repairs?',
    answer:
      'Yes, buy 1-2 extra boxes and store them. Flooring can be damaged over time, and matching the exact color/dye lot later can be difficult or impossible. Many manufacturers discontinue patterns after a few years.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long should flooring acclimate before installation?',
    answer:
      "Most manufacturers recommend 48-72 hours of acclimation in the room where it will be installed. This allows the flooring to adjust to the room's temperature and humidity, preventing expansion or contraction after installation.",
  },

    <p>
      Enter your <strong>room dimensions</strong> in feet - length and width. Measure at the longest points,
      including any alcoves or bump-outs you plan to floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select your <strong>flooring type</strong> (laminate, hardwood, vinyl, or tile) and
      <strong>installation pattern</strong>. The pattern significantly affects waste - diagonal and
      herringbone patterns require more material due to angled cuts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter the <strong>square feet per box</strong> from your flooring's packaging (typically 20-25 sq
      ft) and the <strong>price per square foot</strong> for accurate cost estimates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Add <strong>closets and stairs</strong> if you're flooring those areas too. Don't forget to include
      underlayment and transition strips for doorways.
    </p>
  </ContentSection>

  <!-- Understanding Results Section -->
  <ContentSection title="Understanding Your Results">
    <p>
      The <strong>boxes needed</strong> includes your pattern's waste factor, rounded up to whole boxes.
      You can't buy partial boxes, so always buy the full amount shown.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Waste percentages</strong> vary by pattern: straight patterns are most efficient at 10%,
      while chevron patterns need 25% extra due to the pre-angled cuts and complex fitting at walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>shopping list</strong> includes flooring boxes, underlayment rolls (100 sq ft each),
      and transition strips. Prices are estimates - check your local store for exact pricing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>"Don't Forget" list</strong> shows essential tools and supplies. Having everything ready
      before you start makes installation much smoother.
