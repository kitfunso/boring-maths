// FAQ data
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How much paint do I need for a 12x12 room?",
    answer: "A 12x12 room with 8-foot ceilings has about 384 square feet of wall space. After subtracting doors and windows, you typically need 1.5-2 gallons for two coats. One gallon covers approximately 350-400 square feet per coat."
  },
  {
    question: "How many coats of paint do I need?",
    answer: "Two coats is standard for most painting projects. Use one coat only for touch-ups or when using a paint-and-primer combo over a similar color. Use three coats when making dramatic color changes (especially light over dark), painting over repairs, or for high-traffic areas."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need primer before painting?",
    answer: "Primer is recommended for: new drywall, stained or patched areas, color changes (especially dark to light), glossy surfaces, and wood surfaces. Many modern paints include primer, but a separate primer provides better coverage and adhesion for challenging surfaces."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between paint qualities?",
    answer: "Economy paint is thinner, requires more coats, and fades faster. Standard paint offers good coverage and durability for most rooms. Premium paint has better coverage (often one-coat), superior durability, easier cleaning, and better fade resistance - worth it for high-traffic areas and exteriors."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to paint a room?",
    answer: "A 12x12 room typically takes 4-6 hours for a DIY painter, including prep, two coats, and cleanup. Factors affecting time: ceiling height, number of doors/windows, wall condition, color changes, and experience level. Add 2-4 hours for primer if needed."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I buy extra paint?",
    answer: "Yes, buy 10-15% more than calculated for touch-ups, mistakes, and future repairs. Keep leftover paint for touch-ups - store it properly (sealed, room temperature) and it can last 10+ years. Most stores accept returns of unopened gallons."
