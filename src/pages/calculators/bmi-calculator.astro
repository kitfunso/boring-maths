  {
    question: 'What is BMI and how is it calculated?',
    answer:
      "Body Mass Index (BMI) is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in meters squared (kg/m²). It's a simple screening tool to categorize weight status but doesn't directly measure body fat.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the BMI categories?',
    answer:
      'BMI categories are: Underweight (below 18.5), Normal weight (18.5-24.9), Overweight (25-29.9), and Obese (30 and above). These ranges are the same for all adults regardless of age or gender.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is BMI accurate for everyone?',
    answer:
      "BMI has limitations. It doesn't account for muscle mass, bone density, or body composition. Athletes may have a high BMI but low body fat, while older adults may have normal BMI but high body fat.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What is a healthy BMI range?',
    answer:
      'A healthy BMI is generally between 18.5 and 24.9. However, optimal weight depends on many factors including age, muscle mass, and overall health. Consult a healthcare provider for personalized guidance.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I calculate BMI in pounds and inches?',
    answer:
      'The formula for imperial units is: BMI = (weight in pounds × 703) ÷ (height in inches)². For example, a person who is 5\'10" (70 inches) and weighs 160 lbs has a BMI of (160 × 703) ÷ (70 × 70) = 23.0, which is in the normal range.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What should I weigh for my height?',
    answer:
      "For a normal BMI (18.5-24.9), healthy weight ranges vary by height. At 5'4\" it's 108-145 lbs, at 5'8\" it's 125-163 lbs, at 6'0\" it's 137-183 lbs. Our calculator shows your specific healthy weight range based on your height.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Is BMI different for men and women?',
    answer:
      'The BMI formula and categories are the same for men and women. However, women typically have more body fat than men at the same BMI. For a more accurate picture, consider body fat percentage or waist circumference alongside BMI.',

  <ContentSection title="How to Use This Calculator">
    <p>
      Select your preferred <strong>unit system</strong> - metric (kilograms and centimeters) or imperial
      (pounds and feet/inches).
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter your <strong>height</strong> accurately. For imperial, enter feet and inches separately. Stand
      straight against a wall for the most accurate measurement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter your <strong>weight</strong>. For best results, weigh yourself in the morning before
      eating, wearing minimal clothing.
    </p>
  </ContentSection>

  <ContentSection title="Understanding Your Results">
    <p>
      Your <strong>BMI score</strong> is shown with its corresponding health category. This gives you
      a general indication of whether your weight is appropriate for your height.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>healthy weight range</strong> shows the weight range that would give you a normal BMI.
      This can help set realistic weight goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that BMI is just one indicator of health. <strong>Body composition</strong>, fitness
      level, and other factors are equally important. Consult a healthcare provider for a complete
      health assessment.
