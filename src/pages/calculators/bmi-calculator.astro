  {
    question: "What is BMI and how is it calculated?",
    answer: "Body Mass Index (BMI) is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in meters squared (kg/m²). It's a simple screening tool to categorize weight status but doesn't directly measure body fat."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the BMI categories?",
    answer: "BMI categories are: Underweight (below 18.5), Normal weight (18.5-24.9), Overweight (25-29.9), and Obese (30 and above). These ranges are the same for all adults regardless of age or gender."
  },
  {
    question: "Is BMI accurate for everyone?",
    answer: "BMI has limitations. It doesn't account for muscle mass, bone density, or body composition. Athletes may have a high BMI but low body fat, while older adults may have normal BMI but high body fat."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a healthy BMI range?",
    answer: "A healthy BMI is generally between 18.5 and 24.9. However, optimal weight depends on many factors including age, muscle mass, and overall health. Consult a healthcare provider for personalized guidance."

  <ContentSection title="How to Use This Calculator">
    <p>
      Select your preferred <strong>unit system</strong> - metric (kilograms and
      centimeters) or imperial (pounds and feet/inches).
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter your <strong>height</strong> accurately. For imperial, enter feet and
      inches separately. Stand straight against a wall for the most accurate measurement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter your <strong>weight</strong>. For best results, weigh yourself in the
      morning before eating, wearing minimal clothing.
    </p>
  </ContentSection>

  <ContentSection title="Understanding Your Results">
    <p>
      Your <strong>BMI score</strong> is shown with its corresponding health category.
      This gives you a general indication of whether your weight is appropriate for your height.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>healthy weight range</strong> shows the weight range that would
      give you a normal BMI. This can help set realistic weight goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that BMI is just one indicator of health. <strong>Body composition</strong>,
      fitness level, and other factors are equally important. Consult a healthcare
      provider for a complete health assessment.
