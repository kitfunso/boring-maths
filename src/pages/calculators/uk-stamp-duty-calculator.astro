  {
    question: 'What is Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT)?',
    answer:
      "Stamp Duty Land Tax is a tax you pay when buying property or land in England and Northern Ireland. The amount depends on the property price, whether you're a first-time buyer, and if it's an additional property. Different taxes apply in Scotland (LBTT) and Wales (LTT).",
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the current SDLT rates in England?',
    answer:
      'From April 2025, SDLT rates are: 0% up to £250,000, 5% from £250,001-£925,000, 10% from £925,001-£1,500,000, and 12% above £1,500,000. First-time buyers pay 0% up to £425,000 and 5% from £425,001-£625,000 (properties up to £625,000 only).',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does first-time buyer relief work?',
    answer:
      'First-time buyers in England/NI pay no SDLT on properties up to £425,000, and 5% on the portion from £425,001-£625,000. The relief only applies to properties up to £625,000. In Scotland, first-time buyers get an increased nil-rate band of £175,000 instead of £145,000. Wales has no first-time buyer relief.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the additional property surcharge?',
    answer:
      "If you're buying a second home or buy-to-let property, you pay an extra 5% surcharge (increased from 3% in October 2024) on top of standard rates. This applies to the entire purchase price. The surcharge applies across all UK nations.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Do non-UK residents pay more stamp duty?',
    answer:
      'Yes, non-UK residents pay an additional 2% surcharge on top of all other rates (including the additional property surcharge if applicable). This has been in place since April 2021.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is LBTT in Scotland?',
    answer:
      'Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) replaced SDLT in Scotland from April 2015. The rates and thresholds differ from England. Current bands are: 0% up to £145,000 (£175,000 for first-time buyers), 2% from £145,001-£250,000, 5% from £250,001-£325,000, 10% from £325,001-£750,000, and 12% above £750,000.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is LTT in Wales?',
    answer:
      'Land Transaction Tax (LTT) replaced SDLT in Wales from April 2018. Current bands are: 0% up to £225,000, 6% from £225,001-£400,000, 7.5% from £400,001-£750,000, 10% from £750,001-£1,500,000, and 12% above £1,500,000. Wales has no first-time buyer relief.',
  },
  {
    question: 'When do I pay stamp duty?',
    answer:
      'You must pay stamp duty within 14 days of completing your property purchase. Your solicitor or conveyancer usually handles this on your behalf. Late payment incurs interest and penalties.',
