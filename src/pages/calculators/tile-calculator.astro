// FAQ data
const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'How do I calculate how many tiles I need?',
    answer:
      'Measure your area (length x width) to get square footage. Divide by the area of one tile (convert tile dimensions to feet first). Add 10-20% for waste depending on your pattern. For example, for 100 sq ft with 12x12" tiles: 100 sq ft + 10% = 110 tiles needed.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much grout do I need for tiling?',
    answer:
      'Grout coverage depends on tile size, grout width, and depth. Larger tiles need less grout per square foot. As a rule of thumb: for 12x12" tiles with 1/8" grout lines, expect about 1 lb of grout per 10-15 square feet.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the best tile pattern for waste?',
    answer:
      'Straight (grid) patterns produce the least waste at around 10%. Brick/offset patterns need 12%, diagonal patterns need 15%, and herringbone patterns need 20% or more due to angled cuts at edges.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need backer board for floor tiles?',
    answer:
      'Cement backer board is recommended for wet areas (bathrooms, showers) and required over plywood subfloors. It provides a stable, moisture-resistant substrate. For concrete subfloors in dry areas, you can tile directly with proper preparation.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much thinset adhesive do I need?',
    answer:
      'Coverage varies by trowel size and tile type. A 50 lb bag typically covers 50-100 sq ft for floor tiles with a 1/4" x 1/4" trowel. Large format tiles and uneven substrates require more thinset.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I buy extra tiles?',
    answer:
      'Yes, always buy 10-15% extra for cuts and future repairs. Save leftover tiles - matching exact colors later can be impossible as dye lots vary. Most manufacturers discontinue patterns within a few years.',

    <p>
      Select your <strong>surface type</strong> (floor, wall, backsplash, or shower) and enter the
      <strong>area dimensions</strong> in feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Choose your <strong>tile size</strong> from common options or enter custom dimensions. Select your
      <strong>installation pattern</strong> - this affects waste percentage significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select your <strong>grout width</strong> and check the options for materials you need: grout, thinset
      adhesive, and cement backer board.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter pricing to get <strong>cost estimates</strong>. The calculator automatically adds
      appropriate waste factor based on your pattern choice.

  <!-- Understanding Results Section -->
  <ContentSection title="Understanding Your Results">
    <p>
      The <strong>tiles needed</strong> includes waste factor for cuts and breakage. Round up when buying
      boxes - you cannot buy individual tiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Grout bags</strong> are calculated based on tile size and grout width. Most home improvement
      stores sell 10 lb bags that cover approximately 25-35 sq ft.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Thinset adhesive</strong> coverage assumes a standard 1/4" x 1/4" notched trowel. Large
      format tiles may require larger trowel notches and more adhesive.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Backer board</strong> sheets are 3x5 feet (15 sq ft). Always use cement backer board in
      wet areas like showers and around tubs.
