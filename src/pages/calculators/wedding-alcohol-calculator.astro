// FAQ data
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How much alcohol do I need for 100 guests?",
    answer: "For 100 guests at a 5-hour reception with moderate drinking, you'll typically need about 400-500 drinks total. This translates to roughly 30-40 bottles of wine, 150-200 beers, and 5-8 bottles of liquor. Our calculator adjusts these numbers based on your specific event duration and guest drinking preferences."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the standard drink calculation for weddings?",
    answer: "The industry standard is approximately 1 drink per guest per hour for the first hour, then 0.5-1 drink per hour after that. For a 5-hour reception, plan for about 4-5 drinks per drinking guest. Remember that not all guests drink alcohol - typically 15-20% will abstain."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I split between beer, wine, and liquor?",
    answer: "A common split is 40% wine, 40% beer, and 20% liquor/cocktails. However, this varies by crowd. Younger guests tend to prefer beer and cocktails, while older guests often prefer wine. Consider your guest list when adjusting these percentages."
  },
  {
    question: "How many drinks per bottle should I calculate?",
    answer: "A standard 750ml wine bottle yields 5 glasses. A 750ml liquor bottle makes about 16 cocktails (1.5oz per drink). Beer is typically 1 serving per bottle/can. For champagne toasts, one bottle serves 6 flutes."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I buy extra alcohol for my wedding?",
    answer: "Yes, we recommend buying 10-15% more than calculated to account for spillage, heavier-than-expected drinking, and unexpected guests. Most stores allow returns of unopened bottles within 30 days, so there's little risk in over-buying."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I save money on wedding alcohol?",
    answer: "Buy in bulk from warehouse stores, choose house wines and beers over premium brands, limit the cocktail menu to 2-3 signature drinks, and skip the top-shelf liquor for mixed drinks. Consider a beer and wine only bar to significantly reduce costs."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a bartender for my wedding?",
    answer: "For events with more than 50 guests, professional bartenders are recommended. Plan for 1 bartender per 50 guests. They ensure responsible service, manage the bar efficiently, and can handle complex drink orders."

  <ContentSection title="How to Use This Calculator">
    <p>
      Start by entering your <strong>guest count</strong> and <strong>event duration</strong>.
      Most wedding receptions last 4-6 hours, including cocktail hour. The calculator
      accounts for pre-dinner drinks, dinner service, and dancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adjust the <strong>percentage who drink</strong> based on your guest list.
      Typically, 15-20% of guests don't drink alcohol. If you're having a daytime
      wedding or many families with children, this percentage may be higher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Set the <strong>drinking level</strong> based on your crowd. Light drinkers
      average less than 1 drink per hour, moderate drinkers about 1 per hour, and
      heavy drinkers 1.5+ per hour. When in doubt, go with moderate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, adjust the <strong>drink preferences</strong> to match your guest list.
      Consider offering a signature cocktail with beer and wine to simplify your bar
      while keeping costs manageable.
    </p>

  <ContentSection title="Understanding Your Results">
    <p>
      The calculator shows you the <strong>number of bottles</strong> needed for each
      drink type. Wine bottles (750ml) serve about 5 glasses, while liquor bottles
      make approximately 16 cocktails.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>total drinks</strong> figure represents all servings across all
      drink types. Compare this to your drinking guest count to ensure you have
      enough variety and quantity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember to add <strong>non-alcoholic options</strong> like sparkling water,
      sodas, and mocktails for non-drinking guests. Plan for 2-3 non-alcoholic
      drinks per non-drinking guest.
