    question: 'What fees does Etsy charge?',
    answer:
      'Etsy charges a $0.20 listing fee, 6.5% transaction fee on sale price plus shipping, 3% + $0.25 payment processing, and a small regulatory fee. Offsite ads add 12-15% on sales from external advertising.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What fees does eBay charge?',
    answer:
      'eBay charges a final value fee (typically 13.25% for most categories) on item price plus shipping, plus a $0.30 per-order fee. Payment processing is included in the final value fee.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What fees does Amazon charge?',
    answer:
      'Amazon charges a referral fee (typically 15% but varies by category from 8-17%) plus a $0.99 per-item fee for individual sellers, or $39.99/month for professional sellers. FBA adds fulfillment fees.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Which marketplace has the lowest fees?',
    answer:
      'It depends on your price point and product category. Generally, eBay is competitive for lower-priced items, Etsy for handmade/vintage, and Amazon for high-volume sellers who can offset fees with volume and FBA benefits.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What are Etsy Offsite Ads?',
    answer:
      'Etsy advertises your listings on Google, Facebook, and other platforms. If a sale comes from these ads, you pay 12% (if you make over $10,000/year) or 15% (under $10,000). Sellers making over $10,000 cannot opt out.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I sell on multiple platforms?',
    answer:
      'Multi-channel selling expands reach but increases complexity. Start with one platform to master it, then expand. Ensure your prices account for different fee structures on each platform.',
