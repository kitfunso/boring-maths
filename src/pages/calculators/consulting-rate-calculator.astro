// FAQ data
const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'Why do consultants charge more than employees earn per hour?',
    answer:
      'Consultants pay both employer AND employee taxes (15.3% self-employment tax in US), fund their own benefits, cover business expenses, have no paid vacation or sick days, and bear the risk of inconsistent work. These factors typically mean charging 2-3x what an equivalent employee earns.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How many billable hours should I plan for?',
    answer:
      'Most consultants achieve 60-70% utilization. With 2,080 work hours per year, expect 1,200-1,500 billable hours. Account for vacation, holidays, admin work, marketing, and between-project gaps.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is a reasonable day rate?',
    answer:
      'Day rates typically equal 8x your hourly rate or slightly less. Some consultants offer a small discount for day commitments. Rates vary widely by industry, experience, and location.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I offer project-based pricing?',
    answer:
      'Project pricing often works better for both parties. Clients get budget certainty, and you are not penalized for efficiency. Price projects based on value delivered, not hours - you can often earn more.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I handle retainer clients?',
    answer:
      'Retainers provide income stability. Offer a 10-15% discount for monthly commitment. Ensure the retainer covers a specific scope or hour allocation to avoid scope creep.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What business expenses should consultants budget for?',
    answer:
      'Common expenses include: professional liability insurance, accounting/legal services, software and tools, marketing and website, professional development, home office or coworking space, and travel. Budget $10,000-$25,000/year depending on your business.',
