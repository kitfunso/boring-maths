  {
    question: 'What is Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT)?',
    answer:
      'Stamp Duty Land Tax is a tax on property purchases in England and Northern Ireland. The amount depends on the property price and your circumstances. Scotland has LBTT and Wales has LTT - both are separate tax systems with different rates.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the current SDLT rates for 2025?',
    answer:
      'Standard SDLT rates are: 0% up to £250,000, 5% from £250,001-£925,000, 10% from £925,001-£1,500,000, and 12% above £1,500,000. First-time buyers pay 0% up to £425,000 and 5% from £425,001-£625,000 on properties up to £625,000.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does first-time buyer relief work?',
    answer:
      'First-time buyers pay no SDLT on properties up to £425,000, and 5% on the portion from £425,001-£625,000. This relief only applies to properties priced at £625,000 or less. If the property exceeds £625,000, you pay standard rates on the entire purchase.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the additional property surcharge?',
    answer:
      "If you're buying a second home, buy-to-let, or any additional residential property, you pay an extra 3% surcharge on top of standard rates. This applies to the entire purchase price, not just portions above certain thresholds.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the non-resident surcharge?',
    answer:
      'Non-UK residents pay an additional 2% surcharge on residential property purchases. This applies on top of all other rates including the additional property surcharge. It has been in effect since April 2021.',
  },
  {
    question: 'When do I pay SDLT?',
    answer:
      'You must file an SDLT return and pay the tax within 14 days of completing your property purchase. Your solicitor or conveyancer usually handles this on your behalf. Late payment incurs interest and penalties.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is SDLT the same across the UK?',
    answer:
      'No. SDLT applies only to England and Northern Ireland. Scotland has Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) with different rates and thresholds. Wales has Land Transaction Tax (LTT) with its own rate structure.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I get SDLT relief on my main home?',
    answer:
      "If you're replacing your main residence and the purchase completes before the sale of your old home, you may initially pay the additional property surcharge. You can claim a refund within 3 years if you sell your previous main home within that period.",
  },

        The calculator shows your <strong class="text-[var(--color-cream)]">total SDLT due</strong>
        and the <strong class="text-[var(--color-cream)]">effective rate</strong> as a percentage of the
        property price.
      </p>
      <p>
        SDLT is calculated on a tiered basis - you only pay the higher rate on the portion of the
        price within that band, not the entire property value. The
        <strong class="text-[var(--color-cream)]">band breakdown</strong> shows exactly how much tax applies
        at each tier.
      </p>
      <p>
        First-time buyers will see their <strong class="text-emerald-400">savings</strong> compared to
        standard rates. Additional property buyers and non-residents will see their
        <strong class="text-amber-400">surcharges</strong> clearly itemized.

    </div>
  </ContentSection>

  <ContentSection title="SDLT Rates and Thresholds 2025/26">
    <div class="space-y-4 text-[var(--color-subtle)]">
      <p>
        From 1 April 2025, the temporary SDLT thresholds introduced during the pandemic revert to
        their previous levels. This significantly affects both standard buyers and first-time
        buyers, increasing the amount of stamp duty payable on most property purchases.
      </p>

      <h4 class="font-semibold text-[var(--color-cream)]">Standard SDLT Rates (from April 2025)</h4>
      <p>
        The nil-rate band reverts from £250,000 to <strong class="text-[var(--color-cream)]"
          >£125,000</strong
        >. The full rate structure is: 0% on the first £125,000, 2% from £125,001 to £250,000, 5%
        from £250,001 to £925,000, 10% from £925,001 to £1,500,000, and 12% on any amount above
        £1,500,000. For a £300,000 property, this means paying £5,000 in SDLT compared to £2,500
        under the temporary thresholds — a doubling of the tax bill.
      </p>

      <h4 class="font-semibold text-[var(--color-cream)]">First-Time Buyer Relief</h4>
      <p>
        The first-time buyer nil-rate threshold drops from £425,000 to <strong
          class="text-[var(--color-cream)]">£300,000</strong
        >, and the maximum property price eligible for relief falls from £625,000 to <strong
          class="text-[var(--color-cream)]">£500,000</strong
        >. First-time buyers purchasing a property at or below £500,000 pay 0% on the first £300,000
        and 5% on the portion from £300,001 to £500,000. If the purchase price exceeds £500,000,
        standard rates apply to the entire purchase with no relief.
      </p>

      <h4 class="font-semibold text-[var(--color-cream)]">Additional Property Surcharge</h4>
      <p>
        From 31 October 2024, the surcharge on additional residential properties (second homes,
        buy-to-let investments) increased from 3% to <strong class="text-[var(--color-cream)]"
          >5%</strong
        >. This higher rate applies on top of the standard SDLT bands across the entire purchase
        price. For a £400,000 buy-to-let property, the surcharge alone adds £20,000 to the tax bill.
        Companies purchasing residential property also pay this surcharge.
      </p>

      <h4 class="font-semibold text-[var(--color-cream)]">Non-Resident Buyer Surcharge</h4>
      <p>
        Non-UK residents purchasing residential property pay an additional <strong
          class="text-[var(--color-cream)]">2%</strong
        >
        surcharge on top of all other applicable rates, including the additional property surcharge if
        relevant. This means a non-resident purchasing a second home could pay standard SDLT plus 5% plus
        2% — a total surcharge of 7% on the full property price.
      </p>

      <h4 class="font-semibold text-[var(--color-cream)]">SDLT vs LBTT vs LTT</h4>
      <p>
        SDLT only applies to property purchases in England and Northern Ireland. Scotland uses
