  {
    question: "How is GPA calculated?",
    answer: "GPA is calculated by multiplying each course grade's point value by its credit hours, summing all grade points, then dividing by total credit hours. For example: A (4.0) in a 3-credit course = 12 grade points. If you have 39 grade points across 12 credits, your GPA is 3.25."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between 4.0 and 4.3 scale?",
    answer: "The standard 4.0 scale caps at A = 4.0. The 4.3 scale gives A+ a value of 4.3, allowing students to exceed a 4.0 GPA. Many colleges use the 4.0 scale, but some high schools and universities use 4.3 to reward exceptional performance."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a good GPA?",
    answer: "It varies by context. Generally: 3.5-4.0 is excellent (often Dean's List), 3.0-3.5 is good, 2.5-3.0 is average, and below 2.0 may trigger academic probation. For graduate school, most programs expect 3.0+, while competitive programs want 3.5+."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I calculate cumulative GPA?",
    answer: "Multiply your current GPA by your completed credits to get previous grade points. Add new semester grade points, then divide total grade points by total credits. Example: 3.5 GPA × 60 credits = 210 points + 45 new points = 255 ÷ 75 credits = 3.4 cumulative GPA."
  },
  {
    question: "Do all colleges use the same GPA scale?",
    answer: "No, GPA scales vary. Most US colleges use a 4.0 scale, but some use 4.3 or 5.0 (for weighted honors/AP classes). International schools often use different systems entirely. Always check your institution's specific grading policy."
  },
  {
    question: "What GPA do I need for Dean's List?",
    answer: "Dean's List requirements vary by school, but typically require a 3.5 GPA or higher for the semester with a minimum course load (usually 12+ credits). Some schools have a 3.7 or 3.0 requirement. Check your school's academic policies."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I raise my GPA significantly?",
    answer: "It's harder to raise your GPA as you accumulate credits. Early in college, each semester has a big impact. After 60+ credits, each new grade has less effect on your cumulative GPA. Focus on consistent improvement and target courses where you can excel."

  <ContentSection title="How to Use This Calculator">
    <p>
      First, select your <strong>grade scale</strong>. Most US colleges use a 4.0 scale where
      A = 4.0. Some schools use a 4.3 scale where A+ = 4.3.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to calculate your <strong>cumulative GPA</strong>, check the box and enter
      your current GPA and total credits completed before this semester.
    </p>
    <p>
      Add your courses by entering the <strong>course name</strong> (optional),
      <strong>credit hours</strong>, and <strong>grade received</strong>. Click "Add Course"
      for additional classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your GPA updates automatically as you enter grades. The calculator shows both your
      semester GPA and, if enabled, your new cumulative GPA.
    </p>
  </ContentSection>

  <ContentSection title="Understanding Your Results">
    <p>
      <strong>Semester GPA</strong> shows your grade point average for just the courses
      you entered. This is calculated fresh regardless of previous semesters.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Cumulative GPA</strong> combines your new grades with your previous academic
      record to show your overall standing. This is what appears on transcripts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Grade Points</strong> are calculated by multiplying each grade's point value
      by the course credits. A 4-credit A earns more grade points than a 3-credit A.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>Letter Grade equivalent</strong> shows what your GPA would translate to
      as a single letter grade, plus any academic standing (Dean's List, etc.).
