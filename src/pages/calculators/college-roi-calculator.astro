  {
    question: 'Is college still worth it financially?',
    answer:
      'It depends on your major, school costs, and career path. On average, college graduates earn $1M+ more over their lifetime than high school graduates. However, high student debt, low-paying majors, or expensive private schools can make the ROI negative. STEM, business, and healthcare majors typically have the best financial returns.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is a good ROI for college?',
    answer:
      "An ROI above 100% means you'll earn back double what you invested. ROI above 50% is generally considered good. Anything below 0% means you would have been better off financially without the education. The average 4-year degree has ~300% ROI, but this varies enormously by major and school.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How do bootcamps compare to college?',
    answer:
      "Coding bootcamps can offer excellent ROI (often 200-400%) due to low costs ($10-20K), short duration (3-6 months), and high starting salaries ($60-80K). However, they're specific to tech careers and lack the broader education, networking, and credential signaling of a degree.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What is opportunity cost in education?',
    answer:
      'Opportunity cost is the money you could have earned if you worked instead of attending school. A 4-year degree means 4 years of forgone earnings ($30K-50K/year). This "hidden cost" is often ignored but can be larger than tuition for expensive programs.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does where you go to college matter financially?',
    answer:
      'Elite schools show minimal earnings premium for most students compared to state schools. Exceptions: business, law, and prestige-dependent fields. The main factors affecting earnings are your major, skills, and network - not the school name. Avoid taking on $200K debt for a $50K/year career.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Are trade schools a better investment?',
    answer:
      'Trade schools can be excellent investments: lower costs ($5-15K), shorter duration (6-24 months), and starting salaries of $40-60K+ for skilled trades. Electricians, plumbers, and HVAC technicians often out-earn many college graduates while having less debt.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I calculate my personal college ROI?',
    answer:
      "ROI = (Lifetime Earnings Premium - Total Cost) / Total Cost × 100. Include: tuition, fees, living expenses, interest on loans, and opportunity cost. Compare to what you'd earn with just a high school diploma in your field. Our calculator does this automatically.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I don't finish my degree?",
    answer:
      "Dropping out is often the worst financial outcome: you have the debt but not the degree's earning premium. If you're struggling, consider: community college credits, part-time enrollment, or vocational certificates that provide credentials without a full degree.",

  <ContentSection title="How to Use This Calculator">
    <p>
      Select your <strong>education path</strong> to see default costs and salary expectations for that
      option. You can then customize all values to match your specific situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter <strong>tuition, scholarships, and living expenses</strong>. Be realistic - include
      room, board, books, and transportation if you'll be away from home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Set your <strong>expected starting salary</strong> based on research for your specific major and
      location. The default growth rate reflects typical career progression.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>alternative salary</strong> represents what you'd earn without this education - this
      helps calculate the true opportunity cost of your education.
    </p>
  </ContentSection>

  <ContentSection title="Understanding Your Results">
    <p>
      <strong>ROI (Return on Investment)</strong> shows how much you earn back for every dollar invested.
      100% ROI means you double your money over your career.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Payback period</strong> shows how many years until your education investment is recovered.
      Shorter is better - under 10 years is excellent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Lifetime earnings premium</strong> is the total extra money you'll earn compared to not
      getting this education, after accounting for all costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Debt-to-income ratio</strong> shows loan burden relative to starting salary. Above 1.5x
      indicates potential financial stress.
