    question: 'What is a 401k?',
    answer:
      'A 401k is an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan that allows you to contribute a portion of your pre-tax salary. Contributions grow tax-deferred until withdrawal in retirement. Many employers also match a portion of your contributions, essentially giving you free money.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is employer matching?',
    answer:
      'Employer matching is when your company contributes additional money to your 401k based on your contributions. A common match is 50% of your contributions up to 6% of your salary. If you make $75,000 and contribute 6% ($4,500), your employer adds $2,250.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the 401k contribution limit for 2024?',
    answer:
      "For 2024, the employee contribution limit is $23,000. If you're 50 or older, you can contribute an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution for a total of $30,500. Employer matching contributions don't count toward your personal limit.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How much should I contribute to my 401k?',
    answer:
      "At minimum, contribute enough to get your full employer match - it's free money! Financial experts often recommend saving 10-15% of your income for retirement. If you're starting late, you may need to save more to catch up.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the 4% rule?',
    answer:
      'The 4% rule is a guideline for retirement withdrawals. It suggests you can withdraw 4% of your portfolio in the first year of retirement, then adjust for inflation each year, with a high probability of not running out of money over 30 years.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I contribute to a 401k or Roth IRA?',
    answer:
      'It depends on your tax situation. 401k contributions are pre-tax (reducing current taxes), while Roth IRA contributions are after-tax (tax-free in retirement). Many people do both. Always get the full employer match first, then consider a Roth IRA.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does compound interest work in a 401k?',
    answer:
      'Your 401k grows through compound interest - you earn returns on both your contributions and previous earnings. Over decades, compounding dramatically accelerates growth. Starting early maximizes this effect, even with smaller contributions.',

  <ContentSection title="How to Use This Calculator">
    <p>
      Enter your <strong>current age</strong> and <strong>retirement age</strong> to set your investment
      timeline. The longer you have until retirement, the more time compound interest has to grow your
      wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Input your <strong>annual salary</strong> and <strong>contribution percentage</strong>.
      Remember, contributing at least enough to get your full employer match is essential - it's
      free money you're leaving on the table otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Set your <strong>employer match details</strong> - the percentage they match and the limit. For
      example, 50% match up to 6% means if you contribute 6% of salary, they add 3%.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adjust the <strong>expected annual return</strong> based on your investment style. The S&P 500 has
      historically returned about 10% annually (7% after inflation).
    </p>
  </ContentSection>

  <ContentSection title="Understanding Your Results">
    <p>
      <strong>Total at Retirement</strong> shows your projected 401k balance when you reach retirement
      age. This includes all your contributions, employer matches, and investment growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Monthly Income (4% Rule)</strong> estimates how much you could safely withdraw monthly in
      retirement following the 4% withdrawal rule, which has historically sustained portfolios for 30+
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>contribution breakdown</strong> shows how much comes from your contributions, employer
      matches, and investment growth. You'll often find that investment growth makes up the largest portion
      over time.
