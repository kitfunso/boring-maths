    question: "How is age calculated exactly?",
    answer: "Age is calculated by finding the difference between your birth date and today's date. The calculator accounts for leap years and varying month lengths to give you precise years, months, and days."
  },
  {
    question: "How many days have I been alive?",
    answer: "This calculator shows your total days lived. It multiplies years by 365, adds days for leap years, and accounts for the exact number of days in each month since your birth."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I calculate my age at a specific date?",
    answer: "Use the 'Calculate Age On' field to enter any date instead of today. This lets you find out how old you were or will be on any particular date."
  },
  {
    question: "Are zodiac signs accurate?",
    answer: "The calculator shows both Western zodiac (based on birth month/day) and Chinese zodiac (based on birth year). These are traditional astrological systems and are provided for fun and cultural interest."

    <p>
      Enter your <strong>date of birth</strong> using the date picker. Select
      the year, month, and day you were born.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>target date</strong> defaults to today, but you can change it
      to calculate your age at any point in time - past or future.
    </p>
  </ContentSection>

  <ContentSection title="Understanding Your Results">
    <p>
      Your <strong>exact age</strong> is shown in years, months, and days. This
      is calculated precisely accounting for varying month lengths and leap years.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Life statistics</strong> show your age in different units - total
      days, weeks, months, and hours you've been alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>next birthday</strong> countdown tells you how many days until
      your next birthday and what day of the week it falls on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Zodiac signs</strong> show both your Western astrological sign
      (based on birth date) and Chinese zodiac animal (based on birth year).
