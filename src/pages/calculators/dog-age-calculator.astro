// FAQ data
const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'Is 1 dog year really 7 human years?',
    answer:
      "No, that's an outdated myth. Dogs age much faster in their first two years (reaching about 24 human years by age 2), then slow down. A 5-year-old dog is more like 36 human years, not 35. Additionally, larger dogs age faster than smaller dogs after maturity.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you accurately calculate dog years?',
    answer:
      'Modern calculations consider two factors: dogs age rapidly in years 1-2, then slow down; and larger dogs age faster than smaller dogs. A small dog at age 10 might be 56 in human years, while a giant breed at 10 could be 79. This calculator uses research-based tables for each size category.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Why do small dogs live longer than large dogs?',
    answer:
      "Scientists aren't entirely sure, but large dogs age faster on a cellular level. Big dogs grow very quickly as puppies, which may accelerate aging. Large breeds are also more prone to age-related diseases like cancer. A Chihuahua may live 15-20 years, while a Great Dane typically lives 6-8 years.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the life stages of a dog?',
    answer:
      'Dogs go through five stages: Puppy (0-1 year, rapid development), Adolescent (1-2 years, maturing), Adult (2-7 years, prime of life), Mature (7-10 years, slowing down), and Senior (10+ years, elderly care needed). The exact ages vary by breed size.',
  },
  {
    question: 'When is a dog considered a senior?',
    answer:
      'It depends on size. Small dogs (under 20 lbs) become seniors around 10-12 years. Medium dogs (20-50 lbs) around 8-10 years. Large dogs (50-100 lbs) around 7-8 years. Giant breeds (100+ lbs) may be seniors as early as 5-6 years.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How can I help my dog live longer?',
    answer:
      'Key factors include: maintaining a healthy weight, regular exercise appropriate for age, annual vet checkups (twice yearly for seniors), dental care, quality nutrition, mental stimulation, and lots of love. Early detection of health issues through regular checkups is crucial.',
  },
  {
    question: "What's the average lifespan of a dog?",
    answer:
      'It varies greatly by size and breed. Small dogs: 12-16 years. Medium dogs: 10-14 years. Large dogs: 8-12 years. Giant breeds: 6-10 years. Mixed breeds often live longer than purebreds due to genetic diversity. Individual health and care also play major roles.',
