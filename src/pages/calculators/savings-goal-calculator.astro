// FAQ data
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How much should I save each month?",
    answer: "A common guideline is the 50/30/20 rule: 50% for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for savings. However, your specific savings amount depends on your goals and timeline. Use our calculator to find the exact monthly amount needed to reach your target."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a realistic savings goal?",
    answer: "Realistic savings goals include: 3-6 months of expenses for an emergency fund, 20% down payment for a home, or 10-15% of income for retirement. Start with smaller goals and increase as you build the habit. Our calculator helps you see if your goal is achievable."
  },
  {
    question: "How does compound interest work for savings?",
    answer: "Compound interest means you earn interest on both your principal and previously earned interest. For example, $1,000 at 7% annual return becomes $1,070 after year one. In year two, you earn 7% on $1,070, not just $1,000. This 'interest on interest' accelerates wealth building over time."
  },
  {
    question: "Why should I account for inflation in savings?",
    answer: "Inflation reduces purchasing power over time. If you're saving for a goal 10 years away, that $50,000 will buy less than it does today. At 3% inflation, $50,000 today equals about $67,000 in future dollars. Our calculator shows the real value of your goal."
  },
  {
    question: "What's a good expected return rate for savings?",
    answer: "High-yield savings accounts offer 4-5% (2024). Stock market index funds historically average 7-10% annually. A balanced portfolio might expect 5-7%. Use lower estimates for conservative planning. Our default of 7% represents a moderate investment portfolio."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I contribute weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly?",
    answer: "More frequent contributions slightly increase returns due to earlier investment. However, the difference is minimal - about 0.2% more annually for weekly vs monthly. Choose the frequency that matches your pay schedule for easier budgeting."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I reach my savings goal faster?",
    answer: "Increase contributions when you get raises, automate your savings, reduce expenses, earn more through side hustles, and choose higher-yield investments (with appropriate risk). Even small increases compound significantly over time."

  <ContentSection title="How to Use This Calculator">
    <p>
      Start with your <strong>savings goal</strong> - the total amount you want
      to accumulate. This could be for a house down payment, emergency fund,
      retirement milestone, or any financial target.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter any <strong>current savings</strong> you've already set aside toward
      this goal. Your existing balance will grow with compound interest, reducing
      the amount you need to contribute monthly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Set your <strong>timeline</strong> realistically. Longer timeframes mean
      smaller monthly contributions but more time for market fluctuations.
      Shorter timeframes require larger contributions but offer more certainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adjust the <strong>expected return</strong> based on your investment strategy.
      Savings accounts yield 4-5%, bonds 3-5%, and diversified stock portfolios
      historically average 7-10%. Use conservative estimates for critical goals.
    </p>
  </ContentSection>

  <ContentSection title="Understanding Your Results">
    <p>
      The <strong>contribution amount</strong> is your required periodic savings
      to reach your goal on time. This factors in compound interest earnings,
      making the total contributions less than your goal amount.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Total contributions</strong> shows how much you'll actually put in
      from your pocket. <strong>Interest earned</strong> is the extra money your
      investments generate - this is the power of compound growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>real return rate</strong> shows your actual purchasing power gain
      after accounting for inflation. This is the true measure of wealth building,
      not the nominal return rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>inflation note</strong> reveals what your goal amount will be
      worth in today's dollars. Use this to decide if you should increase your
      target to maintain the same purchasing power.
