    <li>
      <strong>Effective Hourly Rate:</strong> (Revenue - Expenses) ÷ Hours Worked - the real test of profitability
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Marketplace Fees:</strong> Etsy charges ~12-15% total, eBay ~13-15% depending on category
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Profit Margin:</strong> (Revenue - Costs) ÷ Revenue × 100 - aim for 20%+ for sustainable
      business
