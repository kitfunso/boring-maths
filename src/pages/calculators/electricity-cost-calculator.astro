// FAQ data

  {
    question: "How do I find my appliance's wattage?",
    answer: "Check the label on the appliance (usually on the back or bottom), look in the user manual, or search online for '[appliance model] wattage'. The wattage is listed in watts (W). If only amps are listed, multiply amps × volts (usually 120V in US) to get watts."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to run a space heater?",
    answer: "A typical 1,500W space heater running 8 hours a day at $0.15/kWh costs about $1.80 per day, $54 per month, or $648 per year. Space heaters are one of the most expensive appliances to run - consider a programmable thermostat or zone heating instead."
  },
  {
    question: "What uses the most electricity in a home?",
    answer: "The biggest energy consumers are typically: heating/cooling (40-50% of bill), water heater (14-18%), washer/dryer (5-8%), lighting (5-10%), and refrigerator (4-5%). Exact percentages vary by climate, home size, and appliance efficiency."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I reduce my electricity bill?",
    answer: "Top tips: Switch to LED bulbs, use a programmable thermostat, unplug devices when not in use, run dishwasher/washer with full loads, use cold water for laundry, seal air leaks, and upgrade to Energy Star appliances when replacing old ones."
  },
  {
    question: "What's a kilowatt-hour (kWh)?",
    answer: "A kilowatt-hour is a unit of energy equal to using 1,000 watts for one hour. For example, a 100W light bulb running for 10 hours uses 1 kWh. Your electricity bill shows total kWh used and the rate you pay per kWh."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I find my electricity rate?",
    answer: "Check your electricity bill - it shows the rate per kWh (often listed as 'price to compare' or in the charges breakdown). Average US residential rates are about $0.15/kWh, but range from $0.10 in some states to $0.30+ in others."

    <p>
      Use the <strong>quick select buttons</strong> to choose a common appliance, which
      will auto-fill the wattage and typical usage hours. Or enter values manually.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter the <strong>power consumption in watts</strong>. This is usually printed on
      a label on the appliance or in the user manual. It might be listed as "W" or "Watts".
    </p>
    <p>
      Set your <strong>electricity rate</strong> (cost per kWh). You can find this on
      your electricity bill. The calculator starts with an average rate for your region.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adjust the <strong>hours per day</strong> and <strong>days per month</strong>
      sliders to match your actual usage patterns.

  <ContentSection title="Understanding Your Results">
    <p>
      The <strong>monthly cost</strong> is what this appliance adds to your electric bill
      at your current usage rate. The yearly cost helps you see the long-term impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>kWh (kilowatt-hours)</strong> is how electricity is measured. Your bill
      shows total kWh used. One kWh = 1,000 watts running for one hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>per-hour cost</strong> shows what you spend each hour the appliance
      runs. Multiply this by hours of use for any custom calculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>CO2 estimate</strong> uses an average of 0.4 kg CO2 per kWh - actual
      emissions vary by your region's power sources (coal, gas, nuclear, renewables).
