// FAQ data
const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'How much soda do I need for a party of 50 people?',
    answer:
      'For a 4-hour party with 50 guests in warm weather, plan for about 100-120 servings of soda. This translates to roughly 12-15 two-liter bottles or 4-5 twelve-packs of cans. In hot weather, increase by 30-50%. Having a mix of regular and diet options is recommended.',
  },
  {
    question: "How do I calculate drinks for a kids' birthday party?",
    answer:
      "Kids drink slightly less volume but more frequently. For a typical 2-3 hour kids' party, plan for 2-3 drinks per child. Focus on juice boxes (easy to handle, no spills), water bottles, and perhaps a special punch. Avoid too many caffeinated sodas. Our calculator automatically adjusts for the number of children.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How much ice do I need for an outdoor party?',
    answer:
      "A good rule is 1 pound of ice per person for keeping drinks cold, plus extra for serving in drinks. In hot weather (85F+), double this amount. For a party of 25 in warm weather, you'll need about 30-40 pounds of ice (3-4 bags). Buy ice last and store in coolers until needed.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the best drink ratio for a family gathering?",
    answer:
      'For mixed-age family gatherings, a balanced approach works best: 30% soft drinks (sodas), 25% juice, 25% water (still and sparkling), 15% punch/lemonade, and 5% hot beverages. Adjust based on weather - hot days need more water, cold days benefit from hot chocolate or cider.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does weather affect drink consumption at parties?',
    answer:
      'Weather significantly impacts how much people drink. In cold weather (below 50F), expect 0.5 drinks per person per hour. Mild weather (50-70F) averages 0.75 drinks/hour. Warm weather (70-85F) increases to 1 drink/hour. Hot weather (85F+) can reach 1.5 drinks per person per hour. Our calculator automatically adjusts quantities based on your temperature selection.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I buy bottles or cans for a party?',
    answer:
      "Both have advantages. Two-liter bottles are more economical for large groups and work well for punch bowls or serving stations. Cans are more hygienic (no double-dipping), easier for guests to grab, and stay colder longer. For kids' parties, juice boxes and individual water bottles prevent waste and spills.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How far in advance should I buy party drinks?',
    answer:
      'Non-perishable drinks (sodas, bottled water) can be bought 1-2 weeks ahead. Fresh juice should be purchased 2-3 days before. Ice should be bought the day of or day before and kept frozen. Pro tip: Pre-chill bottled drinks in the refrigerator 24 hours before to reduce ice melting.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What non-alcoholic drinks are best for a formal event?',
    answer:
      'For formal events like graduations, showers, or business functions, focus on: sparkling water (40%), elegant punch or fruit-infused water (20%), quality juice (20%), coffee and tea service (15%), and limited sodas (5%). Consider garnishes like citrus slices or fresh mint to elevate presentation.',

  <!-- How to Use Section -->
  <ContentSection title="How to Use This Calculator">
    <p>
      Start by entering your <strong>total guest count</strong> and how many are <strong
        >children</strong
      >
      (under 12). Kids drink slightly less per serving but may want drinks more frequently, and the calculator
      adjusts drink types accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Set your <strong>event duration</strong> - longer events naturally need more drinks. A 2-hour kids'
      party needs far less than an 8-hour family reunion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select the <strong>weather/temperature</strong> condition. This is crucial - hot weather can nearly
      triple drink consumption compared to cold weather. If you're indoors with air conditioning, choose
      "mild" regardless of outside temperature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Choose your <strong>event type</strong> to optimize the drink mix. Kids' parties favor juice, formal
      events lean toward sparkling water and punch, while casual adult gatherings might focus more on
      sodas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, check which <strong>drink types</strong> you want to include. Uncheck any categories you
      don't need, and the calculator will redistribute quantities appropriately.
    </p>

  <!-- Understanding Results Section -->
  <ContentSection title="Understanding Your Results">
    <p>
      The <strong>estimated total cost</strong> gives you a budget baseline using average retail prices.
      Actual costs may vary based on your location, brands chosen, and whether you buy in bulk at warehouse
      stores.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Total servings</strong> includes a 15% buffer over the calculated minimum. This accounts
      for spillage, heavy drinkers, and guests who may return for seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>drinks per person</strong> metric helps you verify the estimate is reasonable. For a
      typical 4-hour event in warm weather, expect 3-5 drinks per guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ice requirements</strong> are calculated based on weather and event duration. Remember that
      ice melts faster in direct sunlight - if your party is outdoors on a hot day, consider buying extra
      or having a backup supply ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>supplies checklist</strong> covers essentials like cups, napkins, and straws. Quantities
      assume 2-3 cups per person (people often set down cups and get new ones).
    </p>
  </ContentSection>

  <!-- Tips Section -->
  <ContentSection title="Party Drink Planning Tips">
    <p>
      <strong>Variety matters:</strong> Even if guests have preferences, offering 3-4 drink types means
      everyone finds something they like. Don't put all your budget into one category.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Temperature control:</strong> Pre-chill all drinks 24 hours before the party. This reduces
      ice needs and keeps drinks cold longer. Use multiple coolers spread around the venue rather than
      one central location.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Kid-friendly setup:</strong> For parties with children, set up a separate drink station
      at kid height. Use cups with lids or go with juice boxes/pouches to minimize spills.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Sustainability option:</strong> Consider large dispensers for lemonade or punch with reusable
      cups instead of individual bottles. This reduces waste and often costs less.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Emergency backup:</strong> Keep a few extra cases of water in reserve. Water is universally
      accepted and essential for hydration, especially in hot weather or for active events.
