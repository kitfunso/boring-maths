  <h3>Brewing Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Gravity Readings:</strong> Always take hydrometer readings at the calibrated temperature
      (usually 60°F/15.5°C) for accurate ABV calculations
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Hop Utilization:</strong> IBU calculations depend on boil time, gravity, and alpha acid
      percentage — higher gravity worts extract fewer IBUs
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Mash Temperature:</strong> Target 148-156°F (64-69°C) for most styles — lower for drier
      beers, higher for fuller body
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Yeast Health:</strong> Proper pitch rates prevent off-flavors and stuck fermentations —
      lagers need roughly twice the yeast of ales
    </li>
  </ul>
