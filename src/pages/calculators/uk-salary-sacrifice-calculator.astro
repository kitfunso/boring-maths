  {
    question: 'What is salary sacrifice?',
    answer:
      'Salary sacrifice is an arrangement where you give up part of your gross salary in exchange for a non-cash benefit from your employer. Because your salary is reduced before tax and National Insurance are calculated, you pay less in deductions. Common salary sacrifice benefits include pension contributions, cycle-to-work schemes, childcare vouchers, and electric vehicles.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much can I save with salary sacrifice?',
    answer:
      'Your savings depend on your tax bracket. Basic rate taxpayers (20%) save around 32% (20% tax + 12% NI). Higher rate taxpayers (40%) save around 42% (40% tax + 2% NI). Scottish taxpayers have different rates. For a £5,000 sacrifice, a 40% taxpayer saves approximately £2,100 in tax and NI.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What benefits can I get through salary sacrifice?',
    answer:
      'Common salary sacrifice benefits include: Pension contributions (most popular), Cycle-to-work scheme (bikes up to £1,000+), Electric vehicle leasing (with low BIK tax), Childcare vouchers (legacy scheme for existing members), Technology schemes (laptops, phones), and Gym memberships. Not all employers offer all benefits.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does salary sacrifice affect my pension contributions?',
    answer:
      "Salary sacrifice pension contributions are paid by your employer on your behalf, so they don't need to be grossed up for tax relief – you get full relief automatically. However, your reduced salary means lower employer NI contributions, which some employers pass on as increased pension contributions.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Will salary sacrifice affect my mortgage application?',
    answer:
      "It can. Mortgage lenders look at your gross salary, and salary sacrifice reduces this on paper. Some lenders will add back pension sacrifice when assessing affordability, but not all. If you're planning a mortgage application, consider timing your salary sacrifice carefully or discussing with your broker.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Does salary sacrifice affect my State Pension?',
    answer:
      "Only if your reduced salary falls below the National Insurance Lower Earnings Limit (£6,396/year in 2024/25). Above this threshold, you continue to accrue State Pension entitlement. For most people, salary sacrifice won't affect State Pension, but check if making large sacrifices.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the rules for cycle-to-work schemes?',
    answer:
      "Cycle-to-work allows you to salary sacrifice the cost of a bike and equipment, typically over 12-18 months. At the end, you can usually purchase the bike for a small residual value (3-7% of original price). There's no legal limit, but most schemes cap at £1,000-£3,000. Electric bikes are included.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How does electric vehicle salary sacrifice work?',
    answer:
      "EV salary sacrifice lets you lease an electric car through your employer at a reduced cost due to tax and NI savings. You pay Benefit in Kind (BIK) tax, but for EVs this is currently just 2% of the car's list price – making it very tax-efficient. You also get insurance, maintenance, and charging included in most schemes.",

    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 text-[var(--color-subtle)]">
      <li>
        <strong class="text-[var(--color-cream)]">Select sacrifice type</strong> – Choose pension, cycle-to-work,
        childcare, or EV based on your benefit.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong class="text-[var(--color-cream)]">Choose your tax region</strong> – Scotland has different
        income tax rates than England, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong class="text-[var(--color-cream)]">Enter your gross salary</strong> – Your annual salary
        before any deductions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong class="text-[var(--color-cream)]">Enter sacrifice amount</strong> – The annual amount

      <p>
        The <strong class="text-[var(--color-cream)]">effective discount</strong> shows your total tax
        and NI savings as a percentage of the sacrifice amount. This is essentially how much "discount"
        you get on the benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong class="text-emerald-400">true cost</strong> is what you actually lose in take-home
        pay. For example, a £5,000 pension contribution might only reduce your take-home pay by £3,000
        – the rest is tax and NI you would have paid anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your <strong class="text-blue-400">employer also saves</strong> on National Insurance contributions
        (13.8%). Some employers share this saving with employees through enhanced pension contributions
        or other benefits.
