// FAQ data
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How do I calculate how much mulch I need?",
    answer: "Multiply your garden bed's length by width to get square footage, then multiply by your desired depth (in feet). For example, a 10x4 foot bed at 3 inches deep needs: 10 x 4 x 0.25 = 10 cubic feet. Divide by 27 to get cubic yards (0.37 cu yds). Always round up when buying."
  },
  {
    question: "How many bags of mulch do I need for my garden?",
    answer: "First calculate cubic feet needed (length x width x depth in feet). Then divide by the bag size. For a 10x4 foot bed at 3\" depth (10 cu ft): you need 5 bags of 2 cu ft mulch, or 4 bags of 3 cu ft mulch. Our calculator shows both options with cost comparison."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the ideal mulch depth for garden beds?",
    answer: "Most garden beds do best with 2-3 inches of mulch. Use 2 inches around perennials and in flower beds, 3 inches for shrub beds and general landscaping, and up to 4 inches for maximum weed suppression in pathways or low-maintenance areas. More is not better - too much mulch can suffocate plant roots."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I buy mulch in bags or bulk?",
    answer: "Bulk mulch (by cubic yard) is usually cheaper for larger projects - typically 50-60% less per cubic foot than bags. However, bags are more convenient for small areas, easier to transport, and better if you cannot receive a bulk delivery. Our calculator compares both options to find your best value."
  },
  {
    question: "What type of mulch is best for garden beds?",
    answer: "It depends on your needs: Wood chips are economical and enrich soil as they decompose (replace annually). Bark mulch lasts longer and looks attractive (18 months). Rubber mulch is permanent and great for playgrounds. Stone/gravel is permanent but does not add nutrients. Straw is best for vegetable gardens."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a cubic yard of mulch weigh?",
    answer: "Weight varies by mulch type: Wood chips weigh about 400-500 lbs per cubic yard. Bark mulch is similar at 500-600 lbs. Rubber mulch is heavier at about 1,000 lbs. Stone and gravel are heaviest at 2,400-2,700 lbs per cubic yard. Consider weight when planning transport."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I replace mulch?",
    answer: "Replacement frequency depends on mulch type: Straw needs replacing every 6 months. Wood chips last about 1 year. Bark mulch lasts 18 months. Rubber mulch lasts 10+ years. Decorative stone is permanent. Organic mulches break down and add nutrients to soil, which is a benefit of replacement."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I put new mulch over old mulch?",
    answer: "Yes, but first rake the old mulch to break up any matted layers and check total depth. Remove excess if adding new mulch would exceed 3-4 inches total. Old decomposed mulch adds nutrients to soil. If old mulch has fungus or disease, remove it completely before adding new mulch."

  <!-- How to Use Section -->
  <ContentSection title="How to Use This Calculator">
    <p>
      Enter your <strong>garden bed dimensions</strong> in feet - length and width.
      For irregular shapes, break them into rectangles and add the totals, or measure
      the longest and widest points for an estimate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select your <strong>desired mulch depth</strong>. Most landscaping professionals
      recommend 2-3 inches for optimal weed suppression and moisture retention.
      Use 4 inches only for pathways or areas needing maximum coverage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Choose your <strong>mulch type</strong> to see accurate weight estimates and
      replacement schedules. Different materials have very different densities -
      stone mulch weighs 5x more than wood chips per cubic foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter your <strong>local pricing</strong> for bulk and bagged mulch. The calculator
      will compare all options and highlight the best value for your project size.

  <!-- Understanding Results Section -->
  <ContentSection title="Understanding Your Results">
    <p>
      <strong>Cubic yards</strong> is the standard measurement for bulk mulch orders.
      One cubic yard equals 27 cubic feet and covers about 100 square feet at 3 inches
      deep. Most landscape suppliers deliver in cubic yard increments.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bag quantities</strong> are shown for both 2 cubic foot and 3 cubic foot
      bags - the two most common retail sizes. The calculator rounds up since you
      cannot buy partial bags.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>cost comparison</strong> shows total price for each purchase option.
      Bulk is usually cheapest for large areas, but bags may be better for small projects
      or when you cannot receive a delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Weight estimates</strong> help you plan transportation. A pickup truck
      typically holds 2-3 cubic yards of wood mulch safely, but only about 1 cubic yard
      of stone due to weight limits.
