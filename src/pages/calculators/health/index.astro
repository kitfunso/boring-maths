    Our health calculators provide quick insights into key wellness metrics. While these tools
    are helpful for general awareness, they're not a substitute for professional medical advice.
    Use them as starting points for discussions with your healthcare provider.

    BMI and calorie calculations are based on established formulas used by health professionals
    worldwide. Your individual results may vary based on factors like muscle mass, bone density,
    and metabolic differences.
