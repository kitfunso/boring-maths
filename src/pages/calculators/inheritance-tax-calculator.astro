  {
    question: 'What is the inheritance tax threshold in the UK?',
    answer:
      'The standard inheritance tax threshold (nil-rate band) is £325,000. Estates valued below this amount pay no inheritance tax. This threshold has been frozen since 2009 and is set to remain at £325,000 until at least April 2028.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the residence nil-rate band (RNRB)?',
    answer:
      'The residence nil-rate band is an additional £175,000 allowance available when you leave your main home to direct descendants (children, grandchildren, stepchildren). This brings the potential tax-free threshold to £500,000 per person. The RNRB is tapered for estates over £2 million, reducing by £1 for every £2 above this threshold.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does the spouse exemption work?',
    answer:
      'Transfers between married couples and civil partners are completely exempt from inheritance tax, regardless of the amount. Additionally, any unused nil-rate band and residence nil-rate band can be transferred to the surviving spouse, potentially doubling the tax-free threshold to £1 million for couples.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Are gifts subject to inheritance tax?',
    answer:
      'Gifts made more than 7 years before death are completely exempt. Gifts made within 7 years may be taxed on a sliding scale (taper relief): 0–3 years = 40%, 3–4 years = 32%, 4–5 years = 24%, 5–6 years = 16%, 6–7 years = 8%. Small gifts up to £250 per person per year and the annual exemption of £3,000 are always exempt.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the inheritance tax rate?',
    answer:
      'The standard IHT rate is 40% on the value of the estate above the nil-rate band. A reduced rate of 36% applies if you leave at least 10% of the net estate to charity. This can be a tax-efficient way to reduce your IHT bill while supporting good causes.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How can I reduce my inheritance tax bill?',
    answer:
      'Key strategies include: making gifts during your lifetime (exempt after 7 years), leaving at least 10% to charity (reduces rate to 36%), using pension funds (usually outside the estate), setting up trusts, taking out life insurance written in trust to cover the IHT bill, and making use of business and agricultural property relief.',
  },
  {
    question: 'When is inheritance tax due?',
    answer:
      'IHT is normally due within 6 months of the end of the month in which the person died. If paid late, interest is charged. For property and certain assets, you can opt to pay in annual instalments over 10 years, though interest still applies on the outstanding balance.',
