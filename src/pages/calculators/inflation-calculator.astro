  {
    question: 'What is inflation and how does it affect purchasing power?',
    answer:
      'Inflation is the rate at which prices for goods and services rise over time, reducing what your money can buy. If inflation is 3%, something that costs $100 today will cost $103 next year. This means your purchasing power decreases unless your income grows faster than inflation.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How is inflation measured in the US?',
    answer:
      'The US measures inflation primarily through the Consumer Price Index (CPI), calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. CPI tracks the average price change of a basket of consumer goods and services including food, housing, transportation, medical care, and more.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the historical average inflation rate?',
    answer:
      'The average US inflation rate since 1920 is approximately 3.3% per year. However, this varies significantly by decade: the 1970s-80s saw double-digit inflation, while the 2010s averaged under 2%. The Federal Reserve currently targets 2% annual inflation.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I calculate future purchasing power?',
    answer:
      'To estimate future purchasing power, divide your current amount by (1 + inflation rate)^years. For example, at 3% inflation, $100 today will have the purchasing power of about $74 in 10 years. Our calculator does this math automatically using historical or custom rates.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What was the highest inflation period in US history?',
    answer:
      "The highest sustained inflation in modern US history occurred during the 'stagflation' era of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Inflation peaked at 13.5% in 1980. The COVID-19 pandemic also triggered high inflation, reaching 8% in 2022.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Has the US ever experienced deflation?',
    answer:
      'Yes, the US experienced significant deflation during the Great Depression (1929-1933), with prices falling nearly 25%. More recently, 2009 saw slight deflation (-0.4%) during the financial crisis. Deflation can be economically harmful as it discourages spending.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How can I protect my money from inflation?',
    answer:
      'Common inflation hedges include: investing in stocks (historically outpace inflation), real estate, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), I-Bonds, commodities, and keeping money in high-yield savings accounts. Holding cash long-term loses purchasing power.',
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between nominal and real returns?",
    answer:
      'Nominal returns are the raw percentage gain on an investment. Real returns subtract inflation, showing actual purchasing power gained. If your investment returns 7% but inflation is 3%, your real return is approximately 4%.',

  <ContentSection title="Understanding Inflation">
    <p>
      Inflation erodes the purchasing power of money over time. What cost $1 in 1920 would cost over
      $15 today. Understanding inflation is crucial for retirement planning, salary negotiations,
      and investment decisions.
