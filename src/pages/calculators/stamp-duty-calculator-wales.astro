  {
    question: 'What is Land Transaction Tax (LTT)?',
    answer:
      "Land Transaction Tax replaced UK Stamp Duty in Wales from April 2018. It's administered by the Welsh Revenue Authority (WRA). LTT is a progressive tax on property and land transactions in Wales.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the current LTT rates in Wales?',
    answer:
      'Standard LTT rates are: 0% up to £225,000, 6% from £225,001–£400,000, 7.5% from £400,001–£750,000, 10% from £750,001–£1,500,000, and 12% above £1,500,000.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is there first-time buyer relief in Wales?',
    answer:
      'No, Wales does not offer first-time buyer relief for LTT. Unlike England (SDLT) and Scotland (LBTT), all buyers in Wales pay the same standard rates regardless of whether they are first-time buyers.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the higher rates for additional properties?',
    answer:
      'Additional properties in Wales attract higher LTT rates: 4% up to £180,000, 7.5% from £180,001–£250,000, 9% from £250,001–£400,000, 11.5% from £400,001–£750,000, 14% from £750,001–£1,500,000, and 16% above £1,500,000.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does LTT compare to SDLT in England?',
    answer:
      'Wales has a higher nil-rate threshold (£225,000 vs £250,000 for England) and different band structures. However, Wales has no first-time buyer relief. For higher-value properties, Wales tends to have slightly higher rates at some bands.',
  },
  {
    question: 'When do I need to pay LTT?',
    answer:
      'LTT must be filed and paid within 30 days of the effective date of the transaction. Returns are filed online with the Welsh Revenue Authority (WRA). Your solicitor or conveyancer typically handles this.',
