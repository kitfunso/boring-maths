    question: 'How much should I spend on a kids birthday party?',
    answer:
      'The average kids birthday party costs $300-$500. A simple home party can be done for $100-$200. Venue parties at activity centers range from $300-$800. Elaborate themed parties with entertainment can exceed $1,000. The key is setting a budget that works for your family.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How many kids should I invite to a birthday party?',
    answer:
      "A common guideline is to invite the child's age plus one (a 5-year-old gets 6 guests). For younger children (under 4), keep it small (4-6 kids). For school-age children, consider inviting the whole class if rules require it, or stick to close friends.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What should I put in goody bags?',
    answer:
      'Budget-friendly options: stickers, bubbles, small toys, candy, play-doh, temporary tattoos. Skip goody bags entirely and do a take-home craft instead. Dollar stores are great for supplies. Aim for $3-8 per bag depending on party style.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much cake do I need?',
    answer:
      'A standard sheet cake serves 24-48 depending on size. A 2-tier cake serves 30-40. Plan 1 serving per child plus parents who stay. Order 10% extra if serving other desserts. Cupcakes are an easy alternative - 1.5 per guest.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long should a kids birthday party be?',
    answer:
      'Ages 1-3: 1-1.5 hours. Ages 4-6: 1.5-2 hours. Ages 7-10: 2-2.5 hours. Ages 11+: 2-3 hours or open-ended for sleepovers. Shorter is often better for young children to avoid meltdowns.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I hire entertainment?',
    answer:
      'Entertainment is optional but can make your job easier. Popular options: magician ($150-300), character appearance ($100-250), bounce house rental ($150-400), face painter ($100-200/hour). DIY games and activities work great for smaller budgets.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I save money on a birthday party?',
    answer:
      'Host at home or a park. Do DIY decorations. Make your own cake. Skip goody bags or make them simple. Limit the guest list. Have a potluck element. Choose a theme that uses items you already have. Party at non-peak times (morning, weekday).',
  },
  {
    question: 'When should I send birthday party invitations?',
    answer:
      'Send invitations 3-4 weeks before the party. For popular dates (summer, holidays), send 5-6 weeks ahead. Include RSVP deadline 1 week before. Digital invitations are free and allow easy tracking.',

  <ContentSection title="How to Use This Calculator">
    <p>
      Enter the <strong>number of kids</strong> expected at the party and your child's <strong
        >age</strong
      >. The calculator provides age-appropriate suggestions based on these inputs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select your <strong>venue type</strong>. Home parties are most affordable, while activity
      centers often include entertainment and cleanup in their package price.
    </p>
    <p>
      Choose your <strong>party style</strong>: simple (basic decorations), themed (coordinated
      colors and characters), or elaborate (professional-level decorations and activities).
    </p>
    <p>
      Adjust individual budget categories based on your priorities. Some families splurge on
      entertainment while keeping food simple, and vice versa.
    </p>
  </ContentSection>

  <ContentSection title="Understanding Your Results">
    <p>
      The <strong>total budget</strong> gives you a realistic estimate including all categories and add-ons
      you selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Cost per child</strong> helps you compare to typical party budgets and make adjustments
      if needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>age-specific tips</strong> are tailored to your child's developmental stage and what
      activities work best for their age group.
