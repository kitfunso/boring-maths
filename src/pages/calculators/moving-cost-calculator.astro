  {
    question: 'How much does it cost to move locally?',
    answer:
      'Local moves (under 50 miles) typically cost $300-$1,500 for a 2-bedroom home with professional movers. DIY with a rental truck runs $100-$400. Costs vary by home size, stairs, and how much stuff you have.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does a cross-country move cost?',
    answer:
      'Cross-country moves (1,000+ miles) typically cost $2,000-$7,500+ for a 2-bedroom home. Costs depend on distance, weight, and services. DIY can save 50%+ but requires significant time and effort.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What hidden costs should I budget for?',
    answer:
      'Often-forgotten costs include: utility connection fees, security deposits, temporary housing, meals during the move, pet boarding, cleaning old/new place, updating vehicle registration, and replacement items damaged in transit.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is DIY moving really cheaper?',
    answer:
      'DIY saves 40-70% on moving costs but adds time, physical labor, and risk. Consider: truck rental, gas, equipment, helpers, food, potential injuries, and value of your time. For small local moves, DIY makes sense. For large or long-distance moves, professionals may be worth it.',
  },
  {
    question: 'When is the cheapest time to move?',
    answer:
      'Off-peak months (October-April) are 20-25% cheaper than peak summer months. Weekdays are cheaper than weekends. Mid-month is cheaper than end-of-month. Avoid holiday weekends and the first/last days of the month.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How far in advance should I book movers?',
    answer:
      'Book 4-6 weeks ahead for local moves, 6-8 weeks for long distance. During peak season (May-September), book 8-12 weeks ahead. Last-minute bookings cost 20-40% more and limit your options.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What does moving insurance cover?',
    answer:
      'Basic coverage (included) pays $0.60/lb per item - woefully inadequate for electronics or valuables. Full value protection costs extra but covers repair or replacement at current value. Consider your renters/homeowners insurance too.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How can I reduce moving costs?',
    answer:
      'Tips: (1) Declutter and sell items before moving, (2) Get multiple quotes, (3) Move off-peak, (4) Pack yourself, (5) Use free boxes from stores, (6) Ship books via media mail, (7) Ask about discounts (military, AAA, senior).',

    <p>
      Select your <strong>move type</strong> based on distance. Local moves are charged hourly, while
      long-distance moves are based on weight and distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Choose your <strong>home size</strong> to estimate the volume of belongings. Larger homes require
      more time, labor, and truck space.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select your <strong>moving method</strong>: DIY (you do everything), Labor Only (movers
      load/unload your rental truck), or Full Service (movers handle everything).
    </p>
    <p>
      Add <strong>additional services</strong> like professional packing, storage, or cleaning to get
      a complete picture of your moving costs.
