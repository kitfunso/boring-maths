    question: 'How much food per person for a buffet?',
    answer:
      'Plan for 1 to 1.25 pounds of food per adult for a full meal buffet. This includes about 6oz of protein, 4-5oz of starch, 4oz of vegetables, and 2-3oz of salad. Add 15% extra for buffet-style service to account for waste and presentation.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How many appetizers per person before dinner?',
    answer:
      'For a cocktail hour before a meal, plan 6-8 appetizer pieces per person for the first hour. For an appetizers-only event, plan 12-15 pieces per person per hour. Variety is key - offer 4-6 different types.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the 50/25/25 catering rule?',
    answer:
      'A common catering guideline: 50% of your food should be starches and grains, 25% protein, and 25% vegetables. This creates balanced portions and helps control costs since starches are typically less expensive than proteins.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I calculate food for dietary restrictions?',
    answer:
      'A safe estimate is 10-15% vegetarian, 5% vegan, and 5% gluten-free. Always ask on your RSVP. Prepare these portions separately and label them clearly. Many dietary-restricted options can work for multiple restrictions.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much dessert should I order?',
    answer:
      'Plan 1 dessert serving per person plus 10% extra. If offering multiple dessert options, total portions should still equal guest count plus buffer. Mini desserts allow guests to sample multiple options.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the difference between plated and buffet quantities?',
    answer:
      'Plated service requires about 5% extra food for kitchen mistakes. Buffet requires 15-20% extra for presentation, seconds, and waste. Plated gives you portion control while buffet offers more flexibility.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How far in advance should I order catering?',
    answer:
      'Book your caterer 2-3 months in advance for large events. Finalize your menu 2-3 weeks before. Provide final guest count 48-72 hours before the event. Most caterers charge for the guaranteed count regardless of attendance.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much bread/rolls should I order?',
    answer:
      'Plan 1.5 rolls per person for a seated dinner. For a buffet with bread station, plan 2 rolls per person. Include butter portions - about 1 tablespoon (1 pat) per person.',

  <ContentSection title="How to Use This Calculator">
    <p>
      Enter your <strong>guest count</strong> and <strong>event duration</strong>. Longer events may
      need additional snacks or refreshments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select your <strong>meal type</strong> based on the occasion. Appetizers-only is great for cocktail
      parties, while heavy meals are appropriate for celebrations where guests expect a substantial feast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Choose your <strong>service style</strong>. Buffet requires more food due to presentation and
      seconds, while plated service offers precise portion control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adjust <strong>dietary restrictions</strong> percentages based on your guest list. When in doubt,
      add extra vegetarian options - they're often enjoyed by everyone.
    </p>
  </ContentSection>

  <ContentSection title="Understanding Your Results">
    <p>
      The <strong>per-person amounts</strong> show recommended portions based on industry standards. These
      account for typical appetite levels and service style waste.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>caterer order guide</strong> provides rounded quantities suitable for ordering from
      caterers or grocery stores. It includes buffer amounts for your service style.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Dietary counts</strong> help you plan separate dishes for guests with restrictions. Some
      overlap may occur (vegetarian who is also gluten-free).
