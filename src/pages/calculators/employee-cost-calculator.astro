// FAQ data
const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'What is the burden rate or burden multiplier?',
    answer:
      'The burden rate is the ratio of total employee cost to base salary. A 1.3x burden means a $50,000 salary actually costs $65,000 when you add benefits, taxes, and overhead. Most employers see a 1.25-1.4x multiplier.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What costs are included beyond salary?',
    answer:
      'Beyond salary, employers pay payroll taxes (FICA, unemployment), health insurance, retirement contributions, training, equipment, office space allocation, and other benefits. These hidden costs add up quickly.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Why does true hourly cost differ from salary-based hourly?',
    answer:
      'A $60,000 salary divided by 2,080 hours gives $28.85/hour. But employees get paid vacation, sick days, and holidays, reducing actual working hours. Add employer costs, and true hourly cost might be $40-50/hour.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I calculate billable rate from employee cost?',
    answer:
      'Divide true hourly cost by (1 - profit margin). For a $45/hour true cost and 30% profit margin: $45 / 0.70 = $64/hour billable rate. This ensures you cover costs and make profit on billable work.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What payroll taxes do employers pay?',
    answer:
      'In the US, employers pay 6.2% Social Security and 1.45% Medicare (7.65% total FICA), plus federal and state unemployment taxes (FUTA/SUTA). In the UK, employers pay National Insurance. Total typically ranges 7-15% of salary.',

    <p>
      The <strong>burden multiplier</strong> shows how much total cost exceeds base salary. A 1.35x multiplier
      means every dollar of salary costs you $1.35 total.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>True hourly cost</strong> is what each hour of employee time actually costs when you factor
      in all expenses and actual working hours (after PTO).
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>billable rate</strong> tells you what to charge clients for this employee's time to
      achieve your target profit margin.
