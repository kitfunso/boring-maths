# Reddit Draft Comments — boring-math.com Traffic

**Strategy:** Find active threads in r/UKPersonalFinance where someone's asking a question our calculators answer. Post a genuinely helpful reply. Link the calculator naturally — not as the answer, but as a tool to explore further.

**Rules:** Keith reviews and posts manually. Never self-promote without adding real value first.

## Draft 1 — Compound Interest / Pension Thread

**Target:** r/UKPersonalFinance threads about pension projections, "am I behind on my pension", compound growth questions

**Comment:**

> The maths is actually quite encouraging once you play with the numbers. At £500/mo with 5% annualised growth, you'd be looking at roughly £115k in 10 years (so ~£165k total by 53). Bump it to £750/mo and you're closer to £200k.
>
> The big variable is growth rate — even 1% difference compounds massively over 10+ years. I'd plug your numbers into a compound interest calculator (boring-math.com has a decent free one) and run scenarios at 3%, 5%, and 7% to see the range. The spread will probably surprise you.
>
> Don't forget employer match too — that's free money that also compounds.

## Draft 2 — Buy vs Rent Thread

**Target:** r/UKPersonalFinance "should I buy or keep renting" threads

**Comment:**

> The break-even point depends massively on how long you stay. If you're only there 2-3 years, the stamp duty + legal fees + mortgage arrangement fees often mean you'd have been better off renting and investing the deposit.
>
> The rough rule of thumb is 5+ years before buying starts winning, but it varies a lot by area. There's a buy vs rent calculator on boring-math.com that lets you plug in your specific numbers (deposit, rent, house price, expected growth) — worth running your scenario rather than guessing.

## Draft 3 — Savings Goal Thread

**Target:** r/UKPersonalFinance "how much do I need to save per month for X" threads

**Comment:**

> Working backwards from the target is the way to go. If you need £X in Y years, the monthly savings amount depends heavily on where you park it — a 5% savings account vs invested in an index fund at ~7% historical average makes a big difference over 5+ years.
>
> I'd run the numbers both ways with a savings goal calculator (boring-math.com/calculators/savings-goal-calculator) — shows you the monthly amount needed at different interest rates side by side.

## Draft 4 — Day Rate / Freelance Thread  

**Target:** r/UKPersonalFinance or r/freelanceuk "what should I charge" threads

**Comment:**

> The formula most people use: (target annual salary × 1.3 to 1.5) ÷ billable days per year. The multiplier covers employer NI, pension, holidays, sick days, insurance, and the fact you won't be billing every day.
>
> For a £60k-equivalent, that's roughly £350-400/day assuming 220 billable days. If you want to play with the variables (tax, expenses, holiday allowance), boring-math.com has a freelance day rate calculator that breaks it all down.
